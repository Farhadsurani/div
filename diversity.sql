(21, 6, 'Welcome to College', NULL, 20, '<p>Welcome back, reader! I&rsquo;m saying, &ldquo;Welcome Back&rdquo; in the event that you have read the previous text called <em>Ugh!?! Not Another Diversity Book</em>, but in the event that you haven&rsquo;t: Spoiler Alert -&nbsp; This book is going to be a lot of fun; this book is going to shift your paradigm regarding classes, professors, sex, drugs, alcohol, safety, life choices, and higher education. Before we get into all that, let&#39;s talk about the real reason you purchased this book. Did you purchase it because it was required for a class? Did you purchase it because it had a clever title? Ooh, &ldquo;Things I Didn&rsquo;t Tell My Mom in College&rdquo;...that sounds scandalous! What could this author, Justin Brown, not tell his mother? Most people who know Justin Brown know that he has a great relationship with his mom. So what could Justin possibly have experienced that he couldn&rsquo;t tell his mom? It&#39;s crazy! Maybe you bought this book because you wanted to get some dirt on the author. If you bought the book for that reason, you&#39;re in luck. If you bought the book because you really don&#39;t know what college students are going through today in the later 2000&rsquo;s, then congratulations, you bought a great book! If you&rsquo;re a parent and you&rsquo;re looking for some insight on how to help your child navigate the rough, crazy and interesting terrain of college, then you are also in luck!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like we did in the previous book, we have to start from the beginning because the beginning really gives us the foundation as to when some people really start to think about college. I remember my beginning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It started early in my 9th grade year of high school. I woke up one morning to the sound of music. In most black households, if you wake up to the sound of music, there are normally two possible reasons: 1. There&#39;s breakfast downstairs, so come down and eat because you&#39;re probably going to be having family over later; which means a busy day... or 2. You&#39;re probably going to be cleaning all day, so get yourself ready to clean. On this particular morning, as I heard the music, I said, &ldquo;Oh God!&rdquo; I ran downstairs as quickly as possible and found everyone already sitting around the table; my mom had made breakfast &ndash; Great! Super excited for mom&rsquo;s breakfast! But, as most stories go, there&rsquo;s a turning point in the story. The turning point went like this: I was asking my sister to pass the pancakes and as she passed the pancakes, my mother looked me right in the eye and said, &ldquo;So Justin, have you thought about college?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I&rsquo;ve thought about college. I&#39;m really excited about (INSERT WHATEVER SCHOOL HERE) and I&rsquo;m really excited about going!&rdquo; My parents looked at me and said, &ldquo;So, have you thought about how you&rsquo;re going to pay for college?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Oh simple. You and dad are going to pay for it.&rdquo; My parents just looked at each other and then back at me and said, &ldquo;Excuse me? Who&#39;s paying for your college?&rdquo; I repeated, &ldquo;You all are.&rdquo; And my parents said, &ldquo;Justin, no, no, no; we&rsquo;re not paying for your college?!&rdquo; I sat there, puzzled, and then I said, &ldquo;Wait, wait, wait! What do you mean you&rsquo;re not paying for my college? So and so&rsquo;s parents are paying for their college!&rdquo; My parents replied back, &ldquo;Well maybe you should live at so and so&rsquo;s house. Look around this table, you have two other siblings.&rdquo; As I looked around the table, my sisters started giving me these really silly faces and funny looks that said, &ldquo;Ha-ha, you can&rsquo;t pay for college!&rdquo; Meanwhile, I&#39;m sitting there thinking, &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; My whole life I thought that my parents had saved up money for me to go to college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, my parents had a little bit saved up but they certainly did not have the means to fully fund my educational experience and also take care of our family.&nbsp; The fact that most parents don&rsquo;t have $120,000 saved up to fully fund their child&rsquo;s college education is a startling revelation for most students. Some parents may, but most don&rsquo;t. So, I said to my parents, &ldquo;Well look, if we don&#39;t have the money to pay for my schooling, then maybe I just won&#39;t go to college.&rdquo; Then came the whole conversation of our background - &ldquo;Slaves died so you could go to college; a lot of people shed blood so that you could further your education; there were a lot of sacrifices made by your grandparents!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;OK, OK, OK, relax! I&rsquo;ll be going to school, don&#39;t worry about it.&rdquo; I hoped my decision, to get an education, would make my parents happy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you read &ldquo;Ugh!?! Not Another Diversity Book&rdquo;, you may remember my initial thoughts about going to college. Since I was a kid, I remember, my parents talking to me about college. I remember being at my grandma&#39;s house and her asking me &ldquo;Hey Justin, do you want to go to college one day?&rdquo; and my reply was, &ldquo;No, I hate school&rdquo;. I was five at the time. I remember my grandma going into a cabinet and conveniently pulling out an old assignment that my uncle completed when he was my age. The assignment asked him what he had done that particular summer and he had written, &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo;. The assignment also asked him how many books he had read that summer and his reply was, &ldquo;Not one darn book&rdquo;. I remember my grandma looking at me and telling me, &ldquo;You know your uncle also hated school at one time, but he went on to get his doctoral degree.&rdquo; Now, literally, twenty years later, I was graduating with my master&rsquo;s degree, with the aspiration of eventually getting a PH.D.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also recall, when I was in the ninth grade, everyone had to meet with their school counselor. My counselor called me in and said she wanted to learn a little bit more about me. She wanted to get an idea of how I was doing academically. She also wanted to discuss my plans post high school. I told her that I wanted to go to college and study Psychology. My school counselor looked at me, right in the eye, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking at your grades and it doesn&#39;t appear that you are college material. Perhaps you should look into a trade or craft? Learning a trade could certainly be beneficial for you. Maybe a trade like...cutting hair, carpentry, plumbing, or working on cars is a better direction for you to consider. These types of skills could be really useful for you in the future.&rdquo; I remember looking at her and saying, &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m going to college&rdquo;. She explained that with my grades, it didn&rsquo;t look like I would get there. Boy was she wrong! This story makes me think about how way too many young students are treated in America. They&rsquo;re told that they can&#39;t do it. Being told you&rsquo;re not good enough and that you won&rsquo;t amount to much in life, can rob a young individual of their self-esteem. This suggests that perhaps, their maturity, their age, or even their experience makes them ill-equipped to successfully achieve their ambitions, goals and dreams. My advice to you would be, &ldquo;If your dreams aren&rsquo;t scary enough, then you&rsquo;re probably not dreaming big enough.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon after that conversation with my counselor, I began touring colleges. By 10th or 11th grade, I had probably visited 60 schools. I&rsquo;m sure some of you are thinking, &ldquo;<em>WHAT</em>!? Visited 60 schools?! Justin, when did you have time to do that?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure where I found the time, but it was important to me and to my parents, so I made the time. At this point, my parents had decided that it was a good idea to enroll me in the &lsquo;Upward Bound&rsquo; program at Lincoln University - not far from where I grew up. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the &lsquo;Upward Bound&rsquo; program, it&#39;s a program that is funded by the U.S. Department of Education. The program is designed to help individuals and students, from low income households, have access to a college education. Ultimately, this means that I went to college during the summer!! Yup, that&rsquo;s right! I went to college during the summers of&nbsp; 9th, 10th, and 11th grades. So, while most students were at the beach getting a tan, (and since I already kind of have an all-natural tan going on), my parents decided that I should further my education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A little history about Lincoln University: Lincoln University was the first HBCU (Historically Black College or University). You may also hear some people refer to Cheyney University as the first HBCU. Most HBCUs were established after the American Civil War, but Cheyney University of Pennsylvania (1837) and Lincoln University (Pennsylvania) (1854), were established for blacks before the American Civil War. The timeline and discussion of who was first, isn&rsquo;t relevant for this story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind, in the household where I was raised, there was no room for and there was no talk of NOT going to college. Both of my parents had their Master&#39;s degrees. I had an uncle and aunt who had their Doctoral degrees. Another aunt had her Bachelor&rsquo;s degree and was working as a teacher. Basically, everyone else I knew had some type of formal, higher education. There was no way that I was going to get out of going to college. When I look at the way that I was raised, my household was kind of like the Cosby show - minus the scandal. Everyone got along, everyone was happy, everyone was educated and college was more than just a concept; it was at the forefront of their thinking and it was a reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that&#39;s part of the reason why I became a college administrator. There were other people I knew, in my community, that didn&#39;t see college as a definite part of their future and in my opinion, if given the opportunity and necessary information, college can absolutely be a for-sure plan for everyone. While you&rsquo;re reading this first chapter, I want to make one perception crystal clear: College <em>can be</em> for everyone, but is not, necessarily, <em>for </em>everyone. Just because college exists, as a system, and is an option for most people, it doesn&#39;t mean that you absolutely have to go to college. News Alert: Some people don&rsquo;t want to go to college! We need blue collar workers just like we need white collar workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was writing this chapter, I was on a plane, sitting next to a gentleman who has been a truck driver for about twenty years. He never went to college. We were talking about the concept of this book and he said, &ldquo;This is a great book you&rsquo;re writing and it&rsquo;s going to be very helpful for parents like me.&rdquo; I asked him what he meant and he replied, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been driving trucks for the last twenty years of my life and I&rsquo;ve made good money, but I don&rsquo;t know a thing about college. My son absolutely wants to go to college. I&rsquo;ve been telling him, you don&rsquo;t have to go to college to be successful, but my son has his heart set on going to college. I honestly don&#39;t know what to tell him.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s the message here? Where does the message come from? Does the message come from parents? Students? College administrators?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think everyone wants to send the same message; there&#39;s a reason for college. There are a lot of different reasons why people go to school. Some people go to college just to get the degree; some people go to learn life skills, such as leadership and development; some people go to college because their parents force them and it was either college, get a full time job or go into the army. Whatever the reason, an education and the experience while obtaining that education are invaluable. Most people go to college so they can get a better job; a better job means more money, but in order to go to college, you need more money! And you need college to get a better job to get more money! It&rsquo;s a vicious cycle. Whatever you decide to do, college or a trade, take this opportunity to elevate your future. Some people may get more than one chance to better their lives, but others only get one chance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This reminds me of my friend Cornelius Rainer. We grew up together and Cornelius was and probably still is one of the most brilliant people that I have ever met. However, Cornelius spent most of his time developing the role of class clown. He would do whatever he could to get a laugh out of everybody. He didn&rsquo;t take school seriously, at all. In fact, Cornelius was drunk when he took his S.A.T.&#39;s!! Can you believe that? And, he still scored a 1650! That&#39;s crazy! Cornelius was one of those students where no matter what the subject was or what material we were learning, it just came easily to him; he didn&#39;t have to try hard and take his studies seriously. While it might take me 48 hours to learn a particular subject, Cornelius could read it the night before, in 20 minutes, and ace the test; meanwhile I would get a B- (if I was lucky). Even though he was a class clown, he was still successful; that always frustrated me about Cornelius. If I&rsquo;m being honest here, I was a little jealous of him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cornelius is an example of a person who only had one chance, he only had one shot and he didn&#39;t take that one chance seriously. College did not end well for Cornelius. When I think back to our college experience, Cornelius went to school but decided that he wanted the &lsquo;hood life&rsquo; more than the college life. His choices bothered me so much. I <em>wish</em> I had the brains he had. I wish I had the ability to effortlessly pick up on concepts like he did. If I had those skills, man, I&rsquo;d be able to take over the world! I thought that he was wasting his talents. I was pissed! I was angry! How could he have all these smarts and just throw it all away for hood life? The streets were more important to him. Cornelius not only had a full scholarship, but he also had outside scholarships that afforded him to have a completely free education. His university housing was paid for, even his meals were paid for and basically anything else you could think of! He was a class clown, he didn&#39;t take school seriously, yet he had the ability to go to college for free! Then when you looked at my situation, I was trying super-super-super hard to get into college. In fact, I went to college most of my summers and yet I had no scholarships to my name, at least not at that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like I said, when we were in college, Cornelius didn&rsquo;t take school seriously at all. By the end of our first semester, his GPA had fallen below a 2.0. His goal was to get an engineering degree, yet he failed math class. How do you fail a math class when that&rsquo;s what you excel in? He just didn&#39;t take school seriously. During the second semester, Cornelius got a 1.7 GPA and had to withdraw from the university. Cornelius never went back to school. I occasionally see him and he typically says, &ldquo;Hey, I wish I had taken college more seriously. I wish someone had held me accountable.&rdquo; His words have always stuck with me; &ldquo;I wish someone had held me accountable. I wish someone would have told me. I wish that I had taken it more seriously.&rdquo; If that story isn&rsquo;t a reason to write a book like this, I don&rsquo;t know what is!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you think about the modern day college student, they have a lot of different personalities and characteristics. They are the digital superiors, meaning that they have technology out the wazoo! Every day they&rsquo;re downloading a new app. Every single day there&rsquo;s a new iPad, iBoard, iPhone, iJar, iPrinter or whatever you want to call the latest technology that&rsquo;s coming out. And for those Android users...we won&rsquo;t talk about you right now. These students like everything and anything that can provide instant gratification. It&rsquo;s as if the days before having a microwave never existed! For these modern day college students, student loan debt is customary; they&#39;re even expecting it. Student loan debt isn&rsquo;t shocking to them, it&rsquo;s the norm; while in the past, student loan debt was insignificant and most people didn&rsquo;t encounter it. Growing older is mandatory, but for some of these students, growing up is optional. We see that a lot of these students are coming in and they lack leadership skills. It&rsquo;s hard when we&rsquo;re trying to help them learn and gain these leadership skills, but the students that are coming in are just too immature to handle these skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Information is also much easier to obtain for these students. Back in my day, when I was going to school, while we had computers, we still used encyclopedias, we still went to the library, and we still had to use multiple sources to gather information. Not all the information I needed was instantaneously obtainable, just by googling! We actually had to manually look up information. When referring to these modern day students, there is also a lot of multi-tasking going on. A lot of these students think that they can do many tasks, at one time. Everybody knows that multitasking isn&#39;t a real thing. If you&#39;re attempting to do multiple tasks at once, you can&#39;t give 100% attention to one specific thing you&#39;re doing; one of the tasks will suffer. I would also say that just about every single one of these students feel the need to have their lives documented. Now, I&rsquo;m not going to lie and say that I don&#39;t participate in these activities, because I do. I&rsquo;m talking about when <em>everything</em> is documented; from what they&#39;re eating, to what they&#39;re sleeping in, to whether they&rsquo;re sliding into someone&#39;s DMs (Direct Messaging), to when they&#39;re going out with their friends; everything is documented and recorded. So, you can see that the modern day, American college student is vastly different than any other college student that exists or has existed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout my college experience (which was six years attending college - from my undergraduate degree and my master&#39;s degree, then working in the field for about five years), I&#39;ve gathered and collected a tremendous amount of information and stories from students, faculty, staff, people from around the country and even people from around the world. I would hear about different situations and different students; how situations went, upcoming trends, things that people need to be careful of, and circumstances that individuals really need to pay attention to. These stories became a cornucopia of knowledge for me. Through all the stories, I&rsquo;m always brought back to Cornelius&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;I wish someone had told me. I wish someone would have held me accountable.&rdquo; <em>That </em>is what this book is supposed to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll let you know now, this book is going to reveal a lot about me personally. There will be a lot of information. Process it and feel free to start a conversation with me about any of the topics. I will tell you that everyone&#39;s college experience is different. What I went through in college and what some of my friends went through in college, may not be what your son or daughter will go through in college or may not be what <em>you </em>will go through in college. Our collective experiences will be not be the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also want to explain how important college administrators are in the college experience. Are we <em>really </em>challenging our students and family and letting them know, &ldquo;Hey this is what college is like&rdquo;? College is very different than what K-12 is. If you look at K-12, we tell our students raise your hand before you go to the bathroom. Now, in an instant, we&rsquo;re bringing them into the college world and we&#39;re saying, &ldquo;OK, choose what you want to do for the rest of your life.&rdquo; These are two very different messages. College administrators will always need to stay ahead of the times and truly figure out what it takes to meet the needs of our students. How are we helping them in this process and are we really addressing student issues in the same way as everyone else? What I mean by that is, there are some college administrators who are bringing up these issues to students and making them aware and then there are others that don&#39;t seem too concerned. There&rsquo;s no consistency. This then leaves parents saying, &ldquo;Well I didn&#39;t know this was going to happen&rdquo; or &ldquo;this was very different than when I went to college.&rdquo; I think it&#39;s very reasonable for parents to think they have an idea of what goes on in college if they went to college, but the college landscape of the modern day college experience has completely changed; not just inconsequentially altered. Yes, some of the things that happened to parents when they were in college are continuing in the current day, but so much has changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People ask me why I wrote this text. I wrote this for a few reasons. I want to provide tips for parents and students throughout the text. You&rsquo;ll notice that there will be times when I talk directly to the parents and other times, I talk directly to students. The advice and wisdom, that I want to give to each, is vastly different. I want the students <em>and </em>their parents to be as prepared as possible. There are going to be times when your child may need your help and there will be times when you should <em>not </em>help your son or daughter and then there will be times, that maybe you should do. For the students, I want to help you understand and be aware of some circumstances you may have already gone through, you may be going through, or things you&#39;ve yet to see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As college administrators, we&rsquo;re noticing a huge disconnect between parents and students. They&rsquo;re simply not having the necessary discussions; there&#39;s no dialogue going on. When we talk to most parents, they say they talk to their child an average of one or two times a week. That might not be you, you may talk to your son or daughter every day. I&rsquo;ve experienced both types of parents, but most parents are calling their child once or twice a week and saying, &ldquo;Hi honey. How&#39;s your day? How&#39;s your week been going? Are you eating? Are you sleeping? How are classes?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s the entire conversation. There&#39;s no conversations about the state of their mental health or questions like &ldquo;Are you going to parties?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Are you drinking?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Are you being safe?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Are you making sure that you get back to your residence hall in a safe way?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Are you taking time to rest?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Are you taking time to exercise?&rdquo;. These things are all important to the college experience. Many parents don&#39;t ask their son or daughter, &ldquo;Are you getting involved?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Are you doing this or that?&rdquo;. Parents are really left out of the loop when it comes to situations that students are facing on college campuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As college administrators, we aren&rsquo;t allowed to call parents and tell them what&#39;s going on. The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) prevents us from advising parents about what&rsquo;s truly going on. It can be frustrating when parents are calling and asking about their son or daughter and we&#39;re not allowed to tell them anything. Most of the time, we encourage the student to call their parent back and let them know what&#39;s going on; but most of the time, the students don&#39;t do that. Perhaps, throughout my ten plus years in higher education, I&rsquo;ve discovered this huge disconnect between parents and students. Who can help create the connection? Well, I hope that this text can help create the connection. There are a lot of different issues, concerns and overall basic knowledge that you&#39;re going to be reading in the next few chapters. There are the prominent issues that are happening in college and then there are the controversial topics and some poignant points that need to be made regarding anyone&#39;s higher education experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I think about disconnects, I think about when universities implement new student orientation. I remember observing one orientation where a college administrator asked the students in the audience, &ldquo;How many of you drink alcohol?&rdquo;. Of course, none of the students raised their hand. Why would they raise their hand and tell on themselves in front of a college administrator? The administrator let them know that it was okay to raise their hand...that no one would be in trouble. They just wanted to see how many incoming students drink alcohol. <em>Now</em>, when the college administrator asked them, &ldquo;How many of you drink?&rdquo;, the majority of the students raised their hands. The average incoming first-year student ranges in age between 17-22, so the majority of them should not be drinking yet; since the legal drinking age is 21. Then the college administrator asked them, &ldquo;How many of you do drugs?&rdquo;. No one raised their hand again. The college administrator said, &ldquo;This also includes marijuana.&rdquo;&nbsp; The majority of their hands went up. The college administrator went on to inform the students of the policies and procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later on in the day, during orientation, the college administrator met with all the parents. Similar questions were asked of the parents: &ldquo;How many of you think that your son or daughter drinks? Raise your hand.&rdquo; Only a few people (I would say about 15%) raised their hand. The college administrator looked puzzled and said, &ldquo;I want to let you know that almost 90% of the students raised their hand when I asked that same question.&rdquo; The parents looked puzzled. They looked as if they were in denial and maybe a little fearful - &ldquo;No way could my son or daughter be doing that. Not my baby. My baby would never do that&rdquo;. Then the big question came up, &ldquo;How many of you think that your son or daughter does drugs?&rdquo; Almost no one in the audience raised their hand. The college administrator said, &ldquo;There&#39;s a huge disconnect here because almost 75% of the students said they did drugs.&rdquo; The parents were in disbelief. They were saying, &ldquo;I&#39;m going to talk to my son or daughter. I can&#39;t believe they said they do drugs.&rdquo; These outcomes, from the questions asked during orientation, let me know that there was a huge disconnect between parents and students; they were not having the meaningful and engaging conversations that they needed to be having.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone thinks that their son or daughter is the most precious living being that has ever walked the earth. You watch them grow up, you watch them accomplish the big milestones, and now you watch them go off to college. I&rsquo;m here to tell you that your son or daughter has definitely not told you every single thing they&rsquo;ve done while they were growing up. Why would they? Your son or daughter needs to have a life of their own and as most kids feel, they need their privacy. At this pivotal time in their lives, it&rsquo;s necessary to build an open relationship with your child and create and atmosphere of trust. College is a new frontier. College is a new life for them. You&rsquo;ll notice when your child comes home for Thanksgiving or winter and spring breaks, they may not be the same person that you dropped off at school a few months ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advice for students: When you know better, you do better. The message I&rsquo;m trying to give you is, when you&#39;re pursuing a college education, make sure you get all the information that you can gather; be a thief! Now&rsquo;s the time to talk about being a thief. Most people think of a thief and think about stealing objects or priceless jewels. Students, the objects or priceless jewels in this situation that you need to steal, is information; gather as much as possible. Use that information superhighway! I say this because, the more information you have, the better your choices and better choices lead to less difficulties. Information gives you the ability to have options. This information will help you to figure out which hall you want to live in or what food plan you want or which major you want to strive towards. You don&rsquo;t want to get to your senior year of your undergraduate career only to find out that you don&#39;t want to pursue that particular path for the rest of your life. When you have the information up front, it allows you to potentially avoid the mistakes that others, before you, have made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout this text, you&#39;re going to read plenty of stories about a lot of different people. Hopefully their stories will inspire you to make different choices when it&#39;s time for your college education. Regardless of what choices you make, your decisions are yours and you have to live with them. Don&rsquo;t live life with regrets. Make sure you&#39;re doing what you want to do because that&#39;s what you want to do; not because someone else wants you to and not because you feel forced or pressured. Have an open dialogue with your parents. Having open dialogue allows your parents to have insight into your life. It helps them to continue molding and guiding you as you venture through this interesting college terrain. Then, even when you&rsquo;re in college, and beyond, continue having an open dialogue with your parents. Although they might not be physically near, it&rsquo;s important to stay in communication with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a known fact that people tend to take advice from others who are not their parents; people who may not have their best interest at heart. For example: You know how your parents give you advice all the time, &ldquo;Oh you should do this or you should do that&rdquo; and you never listen? Then, when you go out on the street, someone tells you the exact same thing and you think, &ldquo;Oh I should do that!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what I hope this text does for you - gives you the advice and instruction you need. That way, you can make the best decisions possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advice for Parents: Each chapter will provide some tips or advice. This information isn&rsquo;t only for the students, but for you as well. First off, we need to continue to support and encourage students. Just because they&rsquo;ve turned eighteen and are out of the house, doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re now full grown adults - they&#39;re not! They still need your leadership, your guidance and occasionally your money. I know some of you may have regrets about things you were unable to do in college or actions you were unable to accomplish in life. Unfortunately, some of those opportunities may be over. You can&rsquo;t live your dreams through your child. Let your son or daughter be who they are. That means, if your child wants to be an art student, encourage them to be an art student; don&rsquo;t force them to be a business student. Don&rsquo;t threaten to not pay for their college education if they don&rsquo;t follow the path <em>you </em>want them to follow. Students, remember, your college education is based on <em>you</em> being able to fund it, not your parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, parents, parents, parents! Please do not be helicopter parents. Not sure what a helicopter parent is? A hel&middot;i&middot;cop&middot;ter par&middot;ent is defined as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>a parent who takes an overprotective or excessive interest in the life of their child or children.\r\n	<ol>\r\n		<li>Some college officials see all this as the behavior of an overindulged generation, raised by helicopter parents and lacking in resilience.</li>\r\n	</ol>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are parents that are here, at the university, more than their children are; you might as well enroll and live in the residence hall. Being a helicopter parent isn&rsquo;t helpful for anybody. It&rsquo;s not helpful to the staff. It&rsquo;s not helpful for the student because they can&#39;t find their own identity since their parents are constantly around. If you&rsquo;re a helicopter parent, you have to learn to let go - just a little bit. Yes, that means cutting the umbilical cord, cutting those apron strings. Pressure&rsquo;s hard, parents! There&#39;s a lot of pressure on students today. We&#39;re going to talk about it throughout the text. There&rsquo;s drugs, sex, the ability to fit in, trying to maintain mental health, making sure that all your class work and other responsibilities are done on time. The college experience itself is getting harder and harder every single year. We&#39;re seeing different trends that just keep popping up. The student experience, it takes a lot. Having pressure from parents doesn&#39;t make it easier for students; they need your support, not your pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parents: Be your child&rsquo;s supporter. The students need support, from all of us. They need us to challenge them but most importantly, they need us to support them. When they call you and they&#39;ve messed up or when they call you and they haven&#39;t done well on a test, or maybe they&rsquo;ve missed a few meals, that is not the time for you tell them why they&#39;re not a good student or why they&rsquo;re not meeting your expectations. Your children have to be able to make decisions for themselves as they&#39;re trying to find and identify who they truly are, now that they&#39;re outside of your house. Knocking them when they&#39;re already down doesn&#39;t help them. You would be surprised at the amount of meetings that I&rsquo;ve had with students where I&rsquo;ve asked them, &ldquo;Well have you told your parents about ____ _____ ____?&rdquo; And the student says, &ldquo;No. I can&#39;t tell my parents because my parents won&#39;t listen&rdquo; or &ldquo;No, my parents wouldn&rsquo;t understand&rdquo; or &ldquo;No, my parents would be really upset if I told them that.&rdquo; That pressure has got to be alleviated, otherwise you&#39;re not going to be able to have those engaging, meaningful and instructional conversations that you need to have with your child. Don&#39;t you want your child to come and talk to you? You&rsquo;re going to have to leave those lines of communication open. Now, this is coming from an individual who has no kids. No Kids Zone! However, if you think of my college students as the administrator&rsquo;s kids, over the past ten years, I&rsquo;ve probably had thousands of kids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another piece of advice would be: Please don&#39;t defend wrong behavior. Some of your children might come to college and find themselves in the midst of a student-conduct situation. Whether they were doing drugs or drinking alcohol, or whatever the situation may be, the last thing anyone needs is a parent calling up to say, &ldquo;Well my son or daughter did drugs or alcohol because they were stressed.&rdquo; or &ldquo;They were peer pressured.&rdquo; Support the university and the code of conduct or set of rules that have been implemented for these very reasons. Parents and students should be informed and educated regarding the code of conduct, so if a situation occurs, no one should be surprised.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a time for your child to learn how to be accountable and take care of their own needs. Don&#39;t do everything for your student. There are times where parents come to our office and say, &ldquo;I need this done and I pay your paycheck.&rdquo; Earlier in the chapter, we discussed how this is the digital age of information, let the students fingers do their own walking.&nbsp; Sometimes students just need to take the initiative and handle situations for themselves. There have been many times when a parent calls up and is asking for information <em>for </em>their child. My reply, &ldquo;Hey, you should probably have your child call and figure this out for themselves. While this is great that you&#39;re calling and trying to get the information, we need students to be advocates for themselves, and we need you, as parents, to be able to put the responsibility and the initiative back on the student.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the flip side, all that talk about responsibility, accountability and initiative, a reminder, we&#39;re not the students&#39; parents; although, sometimes you think we are. We do create really close relationships, but we&#39;re not the students&#39; parents - you are. There are some parents that drop their son or daughter off at school on the first day and we never see or hear from them again and neither does their child. Stay active in your child&rsquo;s education; be involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know this is a lot of information for the first chapter. As the author, I want to suggest that you heed the suggestions and advice provided throughout this book and by all means, reference the information whenever you need it. There are 13 more chapters coming up and my wish is that you pay close attention to the controversial topics that we&#39;re going to be discussing. This is all about the modern day, American college student. These are the issues that they&#39;re facing. These are the trials and tribulations that your child may encounter. Some of the kids are going to have great experiences and some of them, not so much. Ultimately, after reading these chapters, I want parents and their children to feel more confident in having an open dialogue about the college experience. Are these encounters similar to the ones that you&#39;re having in college? Are these issues that you&#39;re going to have to work through as a parent? College was the most fun experience I&#39;ve ever had in my entire life and I hope that your son or daughter&rsquo;s experience in college will be as well. So, let&rsquo;s step back, let&#39;s take a look, and let&#39;s dive into this book. Welcome to college!</p>', '2020-09-07 22:38:06', '2020-09-11 00:01:21', NULL);

(22, 6, 'Your College Experience', NULL, 20, '<p>Congratulations reader! You have made it to Chapter 2! As in my previous book, I want to congratulate you, the reader, when you arrive at Chapter 2. This lets me know that you&#39;re interested in what you&rsquo;ve read so far and curious about what you&#39;re going to read. Full-steam ahead from this point forward! This chapter is called &ldquo;Your College Experience&rdquo; because from this point forward, it&rsquo;s all about the college experience for the average student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was growing up, there were many things that I wanted to be, but a student affairs professional wasn&rsquo;t one of them. Life has a funny way of changing your aspirations. I had to adjust to life&rsquo;s transitions. I had to learn a few lessons before I decided that this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life: To educate those who needed and wanted education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps...If we take a trip down memory lane and see 4-year-old Justin, and you asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up, he would tell you that he wanted to be a trashman. That&#39;s right, a trashman. Some of you are probably saying to yourself, &ldquo;Ewww, that&rsquo;s gross! Why would Justin want to be a trashman? That&#39;s a terrible job!&rdquo; I remember telling my grandma I wanted to be a trashman because I thought the trucks were really cool. The trucks made really loud noises in the morning. The trashmen got to ride on the outside of the trucks; it just seemed super cool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I asked my grandma about being a trashman, her immediate response was, &ldquo;Hey, trashmen make good money.&rdquo; When I talked to my mom about being a trashman, she said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to be a trashman, you want to get an education.&rdquo; As I got a little bit older, maybe 10 or 11, I decided that I wanted to be a cop. Cops are cool; maybe not in 2018, but back when I was a kid in the early nineties, I thought being a cop was cool. I&rsquo;d get to have a gun and a badge and enforce the law. I thought, &ldquo;This is something that I want to do.&rsquo;&rdquo;My mom told me, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be a cop because you&#39;re going to get shot and I don&#39;t want to have sit around all night worrying about whether or not you&#39;re safe out there. So, no, choose something else.&rdquo; I thought, &lsquo;Ok, well maybe I&#39;ll be an actor. Acting is cool. You get to meet celebrities and be on T.V. It will be awesome!&rsquo; I decided I wanted to be an actor when I was watching my favorite show Kenan and Kel. Remember, &ldquo;Who loves orange soda? Kel loves orange soda!&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it true&hellip;. mmmm hmmmm!&rdquo; I know a lot of you know that show. It was my favorite show growing up. I wanted to be just like Kenan and Kel. I thought they were hilarious and I thought that acting was something I wanted to do. Approaching my mom again, I said, &ldquo;Hey, I want to be an actor when I grow up. What do you think about that?&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;No. You can&#39;t be an actor because all they&#39;re going to do is stick you in stereotypical roles where you&#39;ll either be a drug dealer or pimp and I don&#39;t want to see that for you. You need to choose something else.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why do I tell you these stories? I tell you these stories because I think a parents&rsquo; opinion can truly influence what a child chooses for their major, what field they enter and what career path they take. This story is certainly not meant to paint a picture that my mom wasn&#39;t supportive; my mom was extremely supportive. I think my mom wanted me to use my strengths and of course, as my mom, she knew more about my strengths than I did. I remember her always telling me, &ldquo;You know, when you get older, you&#39;re going to need a job where you can publicly speak because you&#39;re really good at speaking in a group setting. So, no matter what you do, you need to have a job where you can speak to the masses, speak to the crowds and inspire them.&rdquo; Well, she was absolutely right since my job, for the most part, is talking to young audiences and being a keynote speaker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To my original point, as a parent, you can either hurt or help your child in regard to what they want their future to look like. I&rsquo;ve seen parents, many times, actually shame or discredit their children&rsquo;s dreams. Making them feel like their dreams are less than, because their child wants to major in the arts or in music or basically anything that has to do with an individualist type of career. Parents are quick to say, &ldquo;No. I don&#39;t want my child to get a degree in that. I want them to get a degree in something they can use, like math or science or business.&rdquo; Parents, your child can obtain more than one degree; they can successfully complete both types of degrees. They can get a degree in art and also get a degree in business, or get a degree in music and also get a degree in the math. Don&rsquo;t stifle your child. A lot of times, when I&rsquo;m talking to students and I ask them about their major, I find out they don&#39;t even like their major but because that&#39;s what they decided in their freshman year, they never changed it or they never changed it because they&#39;re afraid of what their parents might say. Basically, they never legitimately, one hundred percent, decide what they want for their own lives. Parents, allow your children to make those decisions for themselves. You can guide them and give them advice, but ultimately, it should be their decision. While they&#39;re young adults, take a step back and help guide them as they figure out this trajectory of life. They need our help in <em>guiding </em>and <em>advising </em>them, not <em>telling</em> them what to do. Sometimes, they just want us to have their back and let them discover the solution themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parents, another point I&rsquo;d like to mention is, you may have to take the time to re-learn your child. What does that mean? You&rsquo;ve had them, under your wing, since their birth - until about age 17 or 18, but your child will, most likely, change when they go to college. They&rsquo;ll start to learn and experience new things, make new friends, and develop in ways that you could never expect. You may feel that you have a complete stranger in your home when they come home for one of their breaks. You don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about. You don&#39;t understand the clothes they&rsquo;re wearing. You don&#39;t know why the tone of their conversations has changed. While they&rsquo;re away at school, they are evolving and developing into young adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may notice some of their interests or activities have changed. When I went to school I thought I wanted to major in psychology. I found out a little bit about Freud during Psych and I said, &ldquo;SIKE!&rdquo;. In the end, I discovered that Communications is where I wanted to be. At the time, I didn&rsquo;t know that Communications was going to take me somewhere great, plus, psychology wasn&#39;t a good fit for me; Sigmund Freud freaked me out. I was better suited for communications. I had an advisor tell me that I could get paid for working in the communications field. The field encompassed areas such as how we communicate with each other, internally and externally, and how we take messages and make meaning out of them. I couldn&#39;t believe this was even a major! No one ever told me about it. Even at 18, I thought I was pretty knowledgeable and we&rsquo;ve already established that I like to gather a lot of information, but I had no knowledge on this topic. If I wasn&rsquo;t aware of this path, I can only imagine that most students weren&rsquo;t aware of this as an option and probably some other choices that were available. I can tell you now, &ldquo;When you know, you know!&rdquo; As soon as I started taking public relations classes and communications classes, I knew that this was the best fit for me. I was on the right path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom line, students, don&#39;t stay in a major if you&rsquo;re not passionate about it! Don&rsquo;t stick with a major just because you&#39;re afraid of what your parents might think or say. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to make a change and switch. And the sooner you make that change, the better. The longer you wait, the more time you waste and the harder it will be to make that switch. Focus on who you are doing this for. Often times, students tell me that they&#39;re in a particular major because their mom and dad wanted them to be in that major. Remember, this choice should be yours to make. At the end of the day, you are the one who has to live with the path you choose. When it&rsquo;s time for your major to guide you into a career path, you parents won&rsquo;t be the ones going to that job. At least we hope not; maybe the helicopter parents will be there, but most parents will not be. If you&#39;re going to go to college and get a degree, find something that you love, something that you&#39;re passionate about and something that you&#39;re going to enjoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This brings me to a very interesting story about my friend Steve. Steve&rsquo;s dad is an architect. He loves to draw full scale buildings, create designs for landscaping, and develop plans to construct new building structures. Steve&rsquo;s dad is really good at his job! Now, Steve does not like architecture; it was something that he had no interest in. I asked Steve why he didn&#39;t like it and he told me, &ldquo;My dad spent a lot of time hunched over a desk with a spotlight, drawing. He didn&rsquo;t spend a lot of time with me while I was growing up. That&rsquo;s not what I want.&rdquo; So, regardless if Steve was good at drawing and regardless if he liked drawing, he did not want to be an architect. He wanted to do something completely different; he wanted to be a physical therapist. Steve loved sports and wanted to go into athletic training in physical therapy. When the time came for Steve to choose his major and to start choosing classes, his dad was putting a lot of pressure on him about being an architect, telling him, &ldquo;Being an architect is a admirable job son, you&#39;ll make great money and you can make your own hours. You&#39;re really good at drawing; it&#39;s in the genes.&rdquo; What major do you think Steve chose? He chose architecture. His dad paid for all of his schooling and Steve came out with a degree in architecture, from a prestigious university.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steve is now in his thirties and we frequently talk about his choice to become an architect. Steve&rsquo;s excellent at what he does, but he hates it! He hates going to his job. He hates what he&rsquo;s doing. I guess since he has that fancy degree, he may as well use it. The job affords Steve and his wife a good life, but Steve is miserable. He constantly tells me, &ldquo;If I could go back, I wouldn&rsquo;t have chosen this path just because my dad wanted me to. It feels like I&rsquo;ve missed out on a big part of my life.&rdquo; I try to encourage Steve and tell him, &ldquo;Hey, you can always go back and get another degree.&rdquo; I guess at this point, Steve feels like it&#39;s too late. He&rsquo;s married, he has a family, he has a house and he&rsquo;s settled in. It&rsquo;s not really prime time for Steve to pursue a different career path. This is a shining example of choosing a major that&#39;s right for you, after all, this is your life to live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For students - I don&#39;t want what happened to me or what happened to Steve to happen to you. Choose wisely! I finally recognized my calling. As a Communications major, I learned a great deal about the business side of communications, as well as marketing and especially public relations. This is what really interested me &ndash; the drive to get a message out to people and the ability to stand in front of people and publicly speak. It was exactly what I wanted. It was like this major was made for me, yet I still felt unsatisfied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout my time as an undergrad, I had the opportunity to engage in many different student organizations. I worked with the Student Government Association and was a Resident Assistant for three years. I worked with student orientation and in the public relations office as a student leader. I was involved in a lot of student activities and involved in most facets of the institution outside of my academic requirements. Fast forward to my final semester of my senior year, and it was time for me to figure out what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. Like a lot of students, I didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do. I had come to discover the harsh reality that I had gotten a degree in something I ultimately did not want any part of. I couldn&rsquo;t see myself sitting behind a desk every day writing press releases. I didn&rsquo;t want to be on TV, hosting shows. I didn&#39;t want to be a voice on the radio. So, at this point, as far as I was concerned, I had a worthless degree. Had I used my degree to my fullest potential, I could have gone out there and done anything I wanted, but instead I felt stuck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you ever felt like that? Putting all your hopes, dreams, passions, and ideas into something and then that something didn&#39;t produce much fruit? I felt like a seedless tree. Like a tree that had grown to its fullest potential, but without seeds. If seeds can&rsquo;t fall from a tree to the ground, then when that tree&rsquo;s longevity is over, there is no new tree to blossom in its place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the time my senior year ended, I realized I was in a degree program that I didn&rsquo;t want any part of. If you ever find yourself in a major that doesn&#39;t make you happy, change it! I mentioned earlier, I&rsquo;ve spoken to many students, during that first year, about their major choice. It could be the fear of disappointing their parents, or they don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;start over&rdquo;. I&#39;m telling you, if you&rsquo;re not happy with your major, change it! Changing it sooner rather than later still gives you the ability to catch up. Some of those classes can be used as prerequisites and you won&#39;t fall too far behind. What you don&#39;t want to do is continue to take classes in a major that you don&#39;t like because essentially what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re letting your dreams go. Then later, as an adult, you&rsquo;ll realize that that was a mistake; like my friend Steve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point in the game, my senior year, I had no idea what path to follow. I was pretty close with the Director of Public Relations at Slippery Rock University and we had several talks. She was a wonderful mentor to me. I also had a great relationship with one of the Directors of Admissions. I remember both of them telling me that it was clear as day what I wanted to do for the rest of my life and that everybody could see it but me. I said, &ldquo;Well what is it? What am I supposed to do?&rdquo; I honestly had no clue. I had a full scholarship and I had used it on a degree in something that I didn&rsquo;t have much interest in pursuing for the long term. Sure, it was a great fall back plan, but it wasn&#39;t something I was passionate about. It wasn&rsquo;t something that I could see myself really making a difference in and changing people&#39;s lives. They finally shared the secret that I was apparently missing. They said, &ldquo;Justin, you&rsquo;ve been involved in all of these different groups on campus. You definitely want to work with students. You need to go into student affairs.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Student affairs...what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; That is when I first learned what this field was &ndash; supporting students, helping them through their journey, and encouraging their development outside of the classroom. I said, &ldquo;Whaaatt?!&rdquo; It was like everything finally clicked &ndash; the stars were shining and my eyes lit up. I finally realized that all I&#39;ve been doing during my four years in college was not a waste. BINGO! This is exactly what I wanted to do. And <em>that </em>is how being a student affairs professional became a clear career path for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Most people go to college because they want more money. And yes, a college degree can afford you that, but a college degree cannot afford you happiness. There are a lot of people that have degrees but don&#39;t have jobs or they have jobs they don&rsquo;t like. I want to repeat, a degree does not equal jobs and a degree doesn&#39;t always necessarily equal having a lot of money. As student affairs professionals, we don&#39;t make a lot of money at all and the majority of us have master&#39;s degrees; some even have doctoral degrees. For me, it&#39;s more about helping students. I wouldn&#39;t trade money for how it makes me feel, every day, when I see a student reach a goal or I see a student overcome an obstacle or when I see a student develop from their first year all the way to their senior year. That&#39;s not something that I would change for anything in the world. Make sure the degree you&rsquo;re going after is something that you&#39;re passionate about; not necessarily something that makes a ton of money. I guess if you&#39;re someone who really, really likes money, by all means go out there and make as much money as you can; but a career in student affairs is probably not for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s time for the best part of college: Classes! Raise your hand if you love going to classes. I know a lot of you probably didn&rsquo;t raise your hand, and rightfully so. This is especially true during your first year, when the majority of classes you&#39;re in are not part of your major; many are prerequisites. You may notice a theme in the naming of these prerequisite classes, names like: <em>Intro to Psych</em> or <em>Intro to Human Diversity</em> or <em>Intro to Basket Weaving</em>. Regardless of the class name, take your classes seriously. The average student is probably paying $850.00 per credit class; that&#39;s about $2550.00 per individual class. I&rsquo;m sure if you have $2550.00 in your pocket right now, you&rsquo;re not going to waste it. In that first year of college, you will find that a lot of students skip their classes. If you&rsquo;re going to skip your classes, maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t be in college in the first place. I know for me, I don&rsquo;t have an extra $2550.00 to just throw out the window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes the classes you take are not the ones that you really want. Maybe you feel like your prerequisite classes are pointless and even annoying. You may end up learning information that you think you&rsquo;re never going to put to use. As student affairs professionals and for the parents reading this, we&#39;re not supposed to tell students that some of the information they&rsquo;re learning is basically worthless. There are going to be some classes that you&#39;re not going to use or benefit from, probably at any point in your life. Some of the classes are devised to help craft you into a better overall, global citizen. Take what you can from these classes and make the best of the situation. Then when you&rsquo;re in the classes you absolutely need, make sure to pay attention and ace those classes. Get that high G.P.A! Getting a high G.P.A. from the start of your college education is a huge gift. Think about it, it&rsquo;s definitely easier for you to get a high G.P.A. and keep it up than it would be to start low and have to raise it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During your education, you will encounter a variety of different types of professors. My best advice: pay attention to what the professor requires and wants. It&rsquo;s all about the professor&rsquo;s practice. Some professors prefer it if you don&rsquo;t miss any classes, while others don&rsquo;t really mind if you come to class at all, and even others have the 3-day rule where you can&rsquo;t miss more than 3 classes. Some professors are open to students using their cell phones during class, some are not. Some allow students to call them by their first name, others prefer you call them by their last name or with Dr. in front of it. Some professors prefer you come to their office only during office hours to discuss concerns and issues, others are more flexible. Just know that every professor is not made equal. Your experience with one will not be the same as it is with another. I&#39;ve had great experiences with professors and I&#39;ve had bad experiences with professors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I once had a professor named Dr. Benitez and she was amazing! She really pushed me to get to where I wanted to be. She allowed students to text her. She even allowed students to come to her home. She was very hands on and extremely interactive. Some professors do well with this type of communication with their students. These are the professors that you&rsquo;ll notice have incredible relationships with their students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve also had professors that were not so good. I once had a professor named Dr. Bertha and let me tell you she was miserable. Not only was she miserable, she wanted to make sure that you were miserable as well. She gave you assignments that were virtually impossible to complete successfully and then almost triumphed over handing out terrible grades on the assignment. If you spoke to her, as she entered the classroom, she didn&rsquo;t respond; the times that she actually did come to class. She interacted in a negative fashion with many students; particularly, male students and students of color. She had a reputation and it was not a positive reputation. Students simply did not like her. I don&#39;t think I learned too much from Dr. Bertha, but the one thing I did learn from her is that professors are not made equal. Ultimately, you have to give professors what they want, regardless if you agree or not; it&rsquo;s the end to a means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working with some professors can actually feel like &lsquo;academic hazing&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s as if they want you to learn every single factoid about the major they&rsquo;re affiliated with, when in reality, you&#39;re only partnered with them for one class. Make sure that you know what the expectations are from each professor. They are looking to you to satisfy those expectations and reach the common end goal for the class and that&rsquo;s your job! There are only a few finite rules when it comes to having a good relationship with your professors: complete whatever they&rsquo;ve assigned to you, do it in the way they&rsquo;ve asked and do it in the timeframe they&rsquo;ve requested. There are also certain remarks you shouldn&#39;t say to your professor. For example, if you miss a class, you probably shouldn&#39;t go up to your professor and say, &ldquo;Hey, did I miss anything important?&rdquo; Well of course you did! Everything taught in the classroom is important. Another important item to remember: take notice of the office hours for your professors. Professors usually post their hours on their doors. You never know when you might need to visit them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that every single component that you need for a particular class is probably located in your class syllabus? The syllabus is usually given out on the first day of each class. Some upperclassmen may tell you to skip the first day of your class because it&#39;s just a syllabus class and it doesn&#39;t mean anything; that is so far from the truth. That first class is usually a quick class where your professor hands out pertinent class documents; including the most important, the <em>syllabus</em>. The documents and syllabus will equip you with everything that is required and expected of you for the rest of the semester. It includes the professor&rsquo;s policies and procedures. Learn and remember everything these documents provide. It&rsquo;s a good idea to go to that class because this is how you will learn what the rest of the semester will look like for that particular class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing you want to do: make sure the professor knows who you are. You can do this by showing up for that first class. Your relationship with your professor is so important. This relationship can also vary depending on the size of the school you&rsquo;re attending. If you&#39;re at a smaller school, there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll build a close relationships with your professor. Larger schools sometimes make that type of relationship a bit harder. Regardless of the type and size of the institution, you want to make sure that your professor knows who you are; whether that&#39;s by name or where you sit. This was easy <em>and </em>hard for me since I was one of the only students of color in my classes. If I had missed a class, it would&rsquo;ve been quite obvious I wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had some real and authentic relationships with some of my professors. We had a lot of great conversations about their class and my understanding of the content. One professor even took me out for a meal. I went to a smaller school and I was able to build those relationships. That is definitely a benefit of going to a smaller school. At a larger school, you can still benefit from having relationships with your professors, they just may be different than what I experienced at a smaller school. Your experience won&rsquo;t be the same as mine, but the bottom line is, build those relationships!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was in college, I didn&rsquo;t miss a single class. Some of you are probably thinking, aww man, look at him &ndash; goody-two-shoes; he didn&#39;t miss a class. Personally, I didn&rsquo;t want to waste my money and I know a lot of you probably don&#39;t want to waste your money either. I could&#39;ve stayed at home for free, so I wanted to make the most of the opportunity I was fortunate enough to have. You gotta do what you gotta do, and for me that was going to class since that&rsquo;s why I was attending college after all. I would love to tell you that I had an &ldquo;A&rdquo; in every single class but, unfortunately, that wasn&#39;t the case. In some classes, if I managed to get a &ldquo;B&rdquo;, I was okay with that. B&rsquo;s get degrees too! Of course, you should work as hard as you can to get an &ldquo;A&rdquo;, but a &ldquo;B&rdquo; is nothing to be ashamed of. If you&#39;re looking for more ways to reach that &ldquo;A&rdquo;, it&#39;s okay to have a conversation with your professor. Set up time with them and see if there&rsquo;s anything else you can do to reach that goal. Maybe you missed something. Maybe you didn&#39;t do well on a test. Maybe they&rsquo;ll allow you to redo the test. You&rsquo;ll never know your options unless you ask and asking is much easier if you have that relationship with your professor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What kind of relationship do you think is acceptable to have with your professor? Should it be more personal or only professional? I&#39;ve seen and had a lot of different relationships with professors. Some professors, I had strictly professional relationships with. I said &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and &ldquo;bye&rdquo; and it was strictly business and most communication was done by email. I had some professors with whom I had really close relationships with. I&rsquo;d stop by during their office hours frequently.&nbsp; We would talk about family, the weather, and sports. I know some students in college that had sexual relationships with professors. I would strongly recommend staying away from those types of relationships. Those situations never stay quiet. Even if it appears that no one knows, everyone knows! If you are approached with that type of relationship offer, stay away! These situations never end well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trying to figure out if a particular professor is a good fit for you? One option you have is, talk to the upperclassmen. They will definitely give you <em>their </em>opinions on professors. Keep in mind, just because an upperclassman tells you that a professor is easy, doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s the professor for you. You should continually be challenging yourself; easier does not mean better. Another option is, check out online resources such as: <a href=\"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/\">http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/</a>&nbsp; This website will definitely provide different views and opinions on professors. The site will tell you the overall consensus pertaining to a class or professor or how the professor teaches. Of course, as with anything, don&rsquo;t use this website as your only deciding factor. There isn&rsquo;t a website around that will provide you truly unbiased opinions. There have been times when a student receives a bad grade or has hurt feelings relating to a professor or a particular class and they use the website as a forum to personally attack the professor. In the end, if you follow what the professor requires of you, you&rsquo;ll do fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People have asked me, &ldquo;Justin, what was your favorite class while you were in college?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What was the weirdest thing that happened in your college experience?&rdquo; I&rsquo;d like to share a funny story with you. Senior year - final semester: I had to take a class called &lsquo;senior seminar&rsquo;. The general concept of &lsquo;senior seminar&rsquo; is to basically take everything you learned in college and now apply all that knowledge to this class. There are labs, a final presentation, an interview, and creating a resume; all to show that you are fit to go out into society and be a productive citizen. The end result is creating a portfolio. Our last assignment was to interview a professional person, out in the real, working world. We would conduct a mock interview with that person and they would grade us. All of these elements together would determine our final grade for the class. The person I was set to interview worked in a hospital. Even though she worked in a hospital, she had been a communications major and she was an alumni from my institution, so I figured this assignment would be a breeze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I conducted my mock interview and I did very well. At the end of the mock interview, she shook my hand and said, &ldquo;You did a great job. Would you like to grab some lunch at Panera Bread?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Yeah, sure.&rdquo; She and I went to Panera Bread and the conversation was easy and interesting. At one point in the conversation, she asked me, &ldquo;So, do you know anybody from department A?&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;Oh yeah. I know some people in that department.&rdquo; Now remember, even though I was a student, I had always been extremely involved in non-academia. I worked in the admissions office, in the P.R. office and in residence life, which meant I knew a lot of people who worked on campus in some capacity. She then said, &ldquo;Well, my husband works in that department, do you know him?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I think there are only two guys who work in that department. There&rsquo;s the one guy that smokes and then the other guy who doesn&#39;t have a left ear.&rdquo; (Yes, you read that right! This guy did not have a left ear. He was involved in some kind of accident when he was younger and literally lost his left ear.) She blurted out, &ldquo;<em>WHAT?</em>&rdquo; I repeated, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a guy who doesn&#39;t have a left ear and there&rsquo;s a guy who smokes.&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;Smokes? What do you mean smokes?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a guy, with dark hair, who smokes cigarettes.&rdquo; She questioned, &ldquo;And he works in that department?&rdquo; and I responded, &ldquo;Ah, yeah. I work in that department, so I know him.&rdquo; She looks me right in the eye glaring at me. At this point, I&rsquo;m hesitantly looking back at her while she asks, &ldquo;Is his name David?&rdquo; I was like, &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, David. That&rsquo;s his name.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;When was the last time you saw David smoke?&rdquo; At that moment, I knew I had done and/or said something that I shouldn&rsquo;t have. I said, &ldquo;Well, I haven&#39;t seen him recently.&rdquo; She smacked the table loudly and said, &ldquo;Dammit! You will tell me the last time you saw him smoke.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Honestly lady, I don&#39;t know.&rdquo; She then opened up her phone, pulled out a picture of her husband and questions, &ldquo;Is this the guy you&#39;re talking about?&rdquo; It was definitely him so I stated, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I knew it! I knew it! I knew he was still smoking. He told me that he quit and he&#39;s been lying to me. I&rsquo;m going to set him straight right now!&rdquo; So, yes, while we&rsquo;re sitting in Panera Bread, post mock interview, as she&rsquo;s making a scene, she starts typing a text to her husband; showing me what she was typing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As this scene was unfolding before my eyes, I had decided I wasn&rsquo;t going to say anything else. Let&rsquo;s be honest, the reason I was sitting there with her was for a grade and I wanted a good grade! She texts her husband, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still smoking, aren&#39;t you?&rdquo; He just sent a sad face back.&nbsp; She replied, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about this later!&rdquo; She grabbed the rest of her stuff, without giving me my grading sheet, and she walked out of Panera Bread. I quickly followed behind her and asked, &ldquo;Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute. Did I do well? Did I pass?&rdquo; She turned around, glared at me, got in her car and drove off.&nbsp; In the meantime, for the entire next week and a half I was terrified. I was afraid that I was going to fail this class all because of this issue that wasn&rsquo;t even my issue. Sure, I spilled the beans, but how was I to know? I thought, &lsquo;David should get an &ldquo;F&rdquo;! He&#39;s the one who lied to his wife and said he quit smoking! Why me? I didn&#39;t do this. How did I get to this point in my education only to fail senior seminar?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of senior seminar, we had to do a final presentation in front of a panel of our peers and the person that interviewed us. I figured she wasn&rsquo;t going to show up, but she did. I walked right up to her and said, &ldquo;Hi. How are you?&rdquo; In a very soft voice, she said, &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;You never gave me my grading sheet.&rdquo; She looked up at me, smiled and said, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She then handed me the grading sheet and there was an &ldquo;A&rdquo; on it. I inquired about what happened with her situation and she said she didn&rsquo;t want to talk about it. I said, &ldquo;That&#39;s fine.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honestly, as a student, that whole scenario freaked me out! I&rsquo;m telling you this story for a reason. Why? You need to know: Not everything will go according to your plan, choosing classes and making and sticking to a schedule is not easy. There is going to be a time when you embarrassingly walk into the wrong class or even enroll in the wrong class all together. College isn&rsquo;t some cookie cutter event. It&rsquo;s fluid, always in motion and forever changing and while it&rsquo;s changing, you&#39;re changing with it. The students change and the culture changes. When the culture changes, it directly affects everything around a college campus and you&rsquo;ll need to be able to change, learn and grow with it. Use the knowledge and wisdom you&#39;ve been acquiring since you were a child. This will help you navigate within the ever changing college setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For parents: Don&rsquo;t try to relive your dreams through your child. Allow them to figure it out. Allow them to succeed <em>and </em>fail <em>and </em>support them while they&#39;re doing it. Let them choose the major that they&rsquo;re interested in. Guide them and advise them but let them make the final decision. Let your child grow and evolve!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For students: Show up for your classes and make the most out of each one! The reason you&rsquo;re in college is to pursue an education. Take notes, take a lot of notes! Buy those expensive textbooks and keep them. At the end of your college experience, you&#39;ll have a nice library full of academic books. Keep those books, take notes in them, write in them. I know, the majority of you are going to sell your books back and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. If you don&rsquo;t want the books, then get that money! You can utilize the university bookstore or a variety of websites designed just for this purpose. Don&rsquo;t forget to do a price match to see who will pay the most for your book. Choose a major that will land you a career in a field you&rsquo;re passionate about and develop lasting relationships with your professors.</p>', '2020-09-07 22:39:16', '2020-09-11 00:01:17', NULL);

(23, 6, 'Hey Bartender, Another Please!', NULL, 20, '<p>In case you didn&rsquo;t know, alcohol is extremely prevalent on college campuses. You can see this fact portrayed through the media, social media and movies like Neighbors, Superbad or Old School. Alcohol is a huge topic and an even bigger issue on most college campuses. When you go to visit most colleges, they&#39;ll say that their campus is dry. What they&rsquo;re really saying is that their campus is the wettest-dry campus that exists. That said, you will also find that everybody&#39;s experience does not include alcohol. Take me for example, I didn&#39;t drink when I was in college. I had a full scholarship and I didn&#39;t want to mess that up. For some students reading this text, this may be your situation. If you have a scholarship, providing you the opportunity to go to school,&nbsp; one night of drinking is not worth losing your scholarship over. For other students, this may not be the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if administrators say you&rsquo;re not allowed to drink. Students do it anyway. It doesn&#39;t matter if your parents give you the rundown of things that the consequences of drinking have on campus: don&#39;t get an underage drinking charge, don&#39;t get cited, don&#39;t get arrested...students still do it. It seems to be a necessary evil of campus culture. When students go to school, we ask them, &ldquo;What are your expectations of college? What do you think happens on campus?&rdquo; They usually reply, &ldquo;Party, party, party!&rdquo; Students come, they get wasted, they go to fraternity and sorority parties, they get kegs, the whole nine. People are going to drink, you can&rsquo;t stop it. Some student&rsquo;s rooms appear to have more alcohol than your local bar. This is all very common in the campus culture. It&rsquo;s the first time most of these kids are away from their parents. All of those things that they weren&rsquo;t allowed to do at home, they can now do, while in college. Parents aren&rsquo;t around! It&rsquo;s their first taste of freedom. Students are finally getting to explore life, on their own terms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I said earlier that alcohol consumption is a huge issue; especially because most students don&rsquo;t know how to &lsquo;drink properly&rsquo;. We find that students are indulging in heavy drinking and doing it in a short amount of time. They&#39;re not drinking water while they&#39;re doing it. They&#39;re not consuming food beforehand. They&rsquo;re mixing different types of alcohol and once they start drinking for the night, they&#39;re not taking any breaks. They are basically, for the most part, amateurs when it comes to indulging in alcohol. They&rsquo;re getting trashed often and quickly! They don&#39;t know how to just get a nice buzz; they&rsquo;re getting drunk and not being safe about it. BAC (blood alcohol content) numbers are through the roof and poor decisions are being made while they&rsquo;re under the influence of alcohol.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about this fact, some students are already pros at drinking alcohol by the time they even come to college. You&rsquo;re saying to yourself, &ldquo;Justin, how are they a pro when they&rsquo;re just entering college? What, are they drinking in high school?&rdquo; My answer would be, &ldquo;Yes they are. Students are drinking way before the legal drinking age.&rdquo; I believe this happens one of two ways: there&rsquo;s alcohol consumption that takes place in high schools (yes parents, your high school student is probably drinking alcohol) and there are students who are learning drinking behaviors at home. There are kids who are actually drinking with their parents. And of course, there are some kids who are raiding their parents bar. Some parents have no problem with their kids drinking as long as they stay at home and they hand over their car keys. So yeah, some of these kids show up at college already pro-drinkers. Since they&rsquo;re already pro-drinkers, they set out to show their peers what drinking is all about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When parents drink with their underage kids, it can send a negative message. It definitely sends the complete opposite message that we, as staff, are trying to teach and instill in them. If parents are saying that it&rsquo;s okay to drink at home, then they feel it&rsquo;s okay to go off to college and drink. This can become problematic for student affairs professionals because we are attempting to provide a different message to students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our message is more along the lines of, we want you to be global citizens, we want and expect you to be able to follow the law and respect the rules. It&rsquo;s a thin line because the students come back to the staff saying, &ldquo;Well, I drink at home with my parents, so it&#39;s not a big deal.&rdquo; or &ldquo;My parents allow me to drink, so it&#39;s okay.&rdquo; In the meantime, we&rsquo;re trying to hip students to the alcohol culture, reasonable ways to drink or more successful methods of monitoring their alcohol consumption and these students don&rsquo;t want to hear it. They think that they already know the deal. These learned behaviors can also hinder our attempts in helping students to understand their BAC levels. BAC levels can be altered by a multitude of variables, such as: gender, weight, how much you ate during that day, how much you drank, the time frame in which you consumed the alcohol, how much is in a cup or in a shot or in a bottle, as well as the potency of the alcohol or the alcohol proof. There are a lot of factors that can change your BAC. Unfortunately, we&rsquo;re noticing a trend right now and we&rsquo;re seeing extremely high BAC levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When students are in my office for judicial conferences (a judicial conference is a meeting that students have with a university official when they violate policy), I&rsquo;m seeing excessively high BAC levels. The judicial conferences come with a police report and a detailed narrative of the events that took place during the occurrence. Students come and meet with a university administrator to talk about the situation. The administrator&rsquo;s responsibility is to review the files and determine whether or not a student has violated the code of conduct policy. This is a prime time when we&rsquo;re seeing extremely high BAC levels, sometimes as high as a 2.1. All 50 states have now set .08% blood alcohol concentration (BAC) as the legal limit for driving under the influence (DUI) or driving while impaired (DWI). For commercial drivers, a BAC of .04% can result in a DUI or DWI conviction nationwide. In my office, over the course of ten years, I&rsquo;ve seen BAC levels of 2.5. That&#39;s definitely way over the legal drinking limit. These students aren&rsquo;t just getting drunk, they&#39;re getting wasted! Later in this chapter, I&rsquo;ll share some anonymous stories about a few students and situations related to over-intoxication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drinking on campus also depends on what institution you go to. Some state schools don&#39;t allow their students to drink on campus because it&#39;s a legitimate, dry campus.. Some private schools do allow it. They own the land where the school resides and they allow their students to drink in the residence halls. This is something you definitely want to look at when you&#39;re applying to different schools. The student code of conduct and the policies in which they govern their institution can also be very different. People ask me, &ldquo;Justin, it&#39;s crazy to think that students think this is a culture. Alcohol was taken way seriously when I went to school. I would&rsquo;ve thought, in this day and age, that it would be taken even more seriously and students would be drinking less.&rdquo; I would argue that they are not drinking less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think there&#39;s a variety of reasons why students are drinking alcohol; especially consuming large amounts of alcohol at a quick rate. I think that one of the biggest reasons why students are drinking so much alcohol is that they want to make friends and fit in with their peers. Coming to college is an enormous transition; you leave your family behind, your siblings, your friends and the only life you&rsquo;ve known. I think this alone is an immense component to our survival as a human species; we want to be able to feel like we belong, that we&rsquo;re liked, that we have a voice that people care about us and want to be around us. Making friends is probably the most important goal when transitioning into the college life. If there are students coming in, who are already drinking, they&rsquo;ll fit in quicker. Other students will want that same feeling of belonging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We notice that when students feel like they don&rsquo;t fit in or belong, they think, &ldquo;Look, everybody else is drinking. Why don&#39;t I just drink? I&rsquo;ll make more friends that way. At least I&rsquo;ll be involved with other people in the college community. That&#39;s the way for me to feel as though I&#39;m included in what&rsquo;s going on around me.&rdquo; Students may also be drinking out of sheer boredom - where students just don&#39;t have anything to do because they&#39;re not getting involved in campus activities. Some students may start partaking in drinking due to peer pressure. I can remember, when I was in school, people couldn&rsquo;t believe that I didn&rsquo;t drink. They immediately asked, &ldquo;Is it because of your religious beliefs?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Is it because someone in your family has a drinking problem?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Is it because you just don&#39;t want to drink?&rdquo; I usually replied, &ldquo;I tried it before, didn&#39;t like it, don&#39;t like the taste. I don&#39;t drink.&rdquo; I found that as someone who didn&rsquo;t drink, I kind of felt like an oddball or an outsider.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We call people &ldquo;basic&rdquo; if they do the same things that everyone else in mainstream society is doing. Like, basic people just do basic things; they wear the same things, they do the same things, they follow all the trends and crazes. People who don&rsquo;t follow mainstream are considered different, weird or abnormal. This is what it&rsquo;s like on a college campus too. Peer pressure, to fit in, is definitely a big issue. There may be some students who are socially awkward; they just don&#39;t know how to immerse themselves into big group settings. Alcohol gives them the ability to open up. I understand this; it makes a lot of sense. For me, I&#39;m an extrovert. You can put me in front of a room with 100 people and I&#39;ll try to command the room. But, I have friends and colleagues who are the complete opposite and they feel like they need a drink or two in order to open up, to start a conversation. They get a little anxious or a little nervous being around a lot of people. The feelings and effects from alcohol allow them to lower their inhibitions and not worry so much about what other people may think. There are also people who drink because they don&rsquo;t want to feel. They want to escape pain, misery or trauma in their life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a definite that kids are going through a lot in this day and age. Many of our students are coming to college with serious issues. Issues dealing with their family, background, finances, mental health, anxiety, drug and alcohol abuse are some issues our students face. They&#39;re bringing that baggage, from home, with them to campus. Some issues may start once kids get to college, but a lot developed before they arrived. Students are arriving on college campuses with their suitcase full of clothes and another suitcase full of issues. Sometimes when I&#39;m talking with students and I ask them, &ldquo;Why are you drinking?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Why did you drink so much?&rdquo; students respond with a variety of different answers: &ldquo;I&#39;m drinking because my parents are getting divorced. &ldquo;or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m drinking because I just went through a bad breakup.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&#39;m drinking because I did poorly on a test and I really need to maintain a 3.8 GPA so I don&rsquo;t get kicked out.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I just needed an escape.&rdquo; These reasons aren&rsquo;t all that different from a grown adult who drinks, but it&rsquo;s different with the students because we would like them to learn alternative ways of coping with stress and difficult situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that some students have an inaccurate understanding regarding &ldquo;acceptable reasons&rdquo; to drink while in college. I mentioned some of the reasons students have given me when it comes to why they drink. Most of those reasons have to do with stress and coping. There&rsquo;s a whole other rationale for college drinking that I also hear about from students. They say things like, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s college man, that&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to do&rdquo; or &ldquo;Live it up, you only live once&rdquo; or &ldquo;My parents aren&rsquo;t here.&rdquo; The students feel that part of coming to college includes getting plastered, partying and having fun. Yes, drinking is a part of college life for many students, but drinking responsibly is important. Drinking to have fun and also being safe is crucial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students are doing idiotic, irresponsible things because they&rsquo;re not drinking sensibly. We&rsquo;ve heard of students playing drinking games which result in drinking massive amounts of alcohol; like three red solo cups of vodka. That&rsquo;s just too much and it&rsquo;s crazy! Students are ending up in the hospital or ending up arrested or passed out or blacking out. This is putting them in tremendous danger and it&rsquo;s scary! Some students just like the thrill of breaking the law or the thrill of disobeying their parents. I&rsquo;ve had students tell me, &ldquo;My parents gave me this big old speech about why not to drink and I don&#39;t need to hear it from you, too.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Part of the reason why I drink is to spite my parents; they didn&#39;t let me do anything when I was at home.&rdquo; or &ldquo;My parents were very, very strict and now they&#39;re not here; don&rsquo;t judge!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to a story or two involving some students that I remember doing or saying things that were memorable to me. I remember being a resident assistant on campus and having to sit at the front desk for some shifts. Let me tell you, when you sit at the front desk being a resident assistant, you see some crazy things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the stories that I remember very well is: A student got so drunk that he walked into one of his neighbor&#39;s houses and stole their dog. That&rsquo;s right, the student went into his neighbor&rsquo;s house, leashed the neighbor&#39;s dog and brought it to the residence hall. What I found interesting about this situation is that the student didn&#39;t live in that particular residence hall. The student was an upperclassman and must have lived in that residence hall in years past, but now lived off-campus. Because he was so drunk, he thought that that&#39;s where he lived. I remember coming up to the window and him saying to me, &ldquo;Hey, I lost my key and I can&#39;t get into the residence hall.&rdquo; I looked down at his feet and saw a Labrador Retriever and I said, &ldquo;You can&#39;t bring that dog into the building.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Oh no&hellip;it&rsquo;s okay, he lives here with me.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;No, no, no he does not live here. There are no dogs allowed here.&rdquo; At the time, service dogs or emotional support pets weren&rsquo;t a big thing yet; even seeing eye dogs weren&rsquo;t that prevalent then. You could tell that this dog wasn&rsquo;t a guide or service dog. You could see that the guy was extremely intoxicated. I told him to have a seat and someone would be there shortly to help him. Unfortunately, I had to call the police because that&#39;s what resident assistants are advised to do.&nbsp; I remember we sat there and talked and I asked him a few questions. I said, &ldquo;Where were you tonight?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Oh, I came from one of the fraternity houses in town.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Okay. Did you drink there?&rdquo; He responded, &ldquo;Yeah man. It was a great party.&rdquo; I was like, &ldquo;That&#39;s awesome.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I just found this dog while I was walking the streets.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;WHAT?!&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yeah man. I was walking and saw this dog was all by himself and I was by myself, so we decided to become friends.&rdquo; He looks at the dog and starts talking to the dog, saying, &ldquo;Hey, you&#39;re a good boy. It&#39;s okay, we&#39;re almost home.&rdquo; Thankfully, the dog was very friendly. The dog was licking him and it seemed like they knew each other and were friends. Eventually the police came on the scene and they handled the situation. They later found out that there was also a local report that someone had broken into a house and stolen a Labrador retriever. Well, this was the guy. Eventually he was arrested and escorted out of the building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why did I tell you this story? I ended up bumping into this guy later in the school year. We were both in the library. Since I&rsquo;m a silly kind of guy, when this situation happened earlier in the year, I had taken some pictures of him; just for fun, like a keepsake of the night. I said to him, &ldquo;Dude, you were in my building the day you got arrested.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yeah man. I don&#39;t know what happened. I was so out of it.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Look dude, I took pictures of you.&rdquo; I showed him the pictures and he laughed and said, &ldquo;I can&#39;t believe I did that. I don&#39;t even know whose dog it was.&rdquo; I asked him, &ldquo;Well what happened?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Man, I just drank so much I don&#39;t even know what happened that night.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s a scary situation to be in? While it&rsquo;s silly about him stealing a dog and thinking the dog was his and trying to get back into his old residence hall, this is not <em>just</em> a &ldquo;funny&rdquo; situation, it&rsquo;s also very serious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s definitely not funny when people get behind the wheel of a car and make the decision to drive drunk or when students are handling weapons like knives or lighters and they end up cutting themselves or burning something. Student injury due to alcohol consumption happens and it happens often. Students are leaving parties and walking home, tripping and falling and injuring themselves to the extent of hospitalization. They may even find themselves attempting to get into bed and they end up falling out of their bed and getting injured. Then there are the instances when a student does something that results in a major issue, like in the following story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember a student who was so drunk that they passed out in their shower. Since the student was in the shower, no one came to check in on them because they thought someone was just <em>in </em>the shower. Unfortunately, the person had passed out in the shower. The only reason that anyone knew something was wrong was because the shower ran all night and the water from the shower seeped down into the next floor and flooded the building. After everyone evacuated, we had to &ldquo;key into&rdquo; the room. We found the student passed-out in the shower. The student was immediately sent to the hospital. The student could&rsquo;ve drowned, or worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, these are extreme cases when it comes to intoxication. I can say that in most instances, students go to off-campus parties, they drink, they make their way back to campus and everything is fine; but sometimes, that&rsquo;s not how the story goes. I remember another student who was in the lobby waiting for her friends and she was extremely drunk. At the time, at this institution, the policy stated that as long as the person wasn&rsquo;t a safety risk to themselves or others, we wouldn&rsquo;t call the police. I remember looking over at her and she started screaming. I had no idea why she was screaming; everything seemed fine. She stood up and I saw that she had peed herself. How do you get so drunk that you can&#39;t control your own bladder? That&rsquo;s really bad!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students should understand that drinking alcohol can have consequences. If you&rsquo;re going to drink, do it responsibly and safely. If you plan on drinking, even if your parents have expressed that they would prefer you not to, I would encourage you to have a plan. Only drink with people you know and trust; people who will make sure you&rsquo;re okay and will have your back. If a group is all going out at one time, make sure you all come back together. Make a decision, before you go out, as to how much you&rsquo;re going to drink. If you see a friend and they&#39;re too drunk, tell them, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to go home.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re traveling to a party in a car, make sure that you have a trustworthy designated driver. DD&rsquo;s are super important. I usually find in most groups that there&rsquo;s one person who doesn&rsquo;t drink or doesn&rsquo;t drink much. My advice would be: never get behind the wheel of a car if you&rsquo;ve had <em>any </em>alcohol to drink, even a sip is too much; it&rsquo;s not worth the risk. Be safe and make good decisions. When you&rsquo;re out and about, you not only have to worry about yourself, but you also have to worry about your friends and others around you. If you know you&rsquo;re going to drink, make sure you eat something. You don&rsquo;t have to go out of your way to have a full meal, but have something in your stomach, before you start drinking. You can&#39;t drink on an empty stomach. If you&rsquo;re out drinking, make sure you take breaks in between drinks. Don&rsquo;t just slam drinks continuously. In between alcoholic drinks, supplement with water or juice. My last piece of advice would be to know your limits! Some people can drink a lot and good for them, but your body may not react the same way. You don&rsquo;t have to keep up, drink-for-drink, with your friends. It&rsquo;s not a competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s another story and this one is pretty scary. This story involves a student who was so drunk she didn&rsquo;t know where she was. I was on duty one night and the student was arrested due to public intoxication. At this particular institution, when students got arrested and later brought back to the residence hall, it was the resident director&rsquo;s job to follow up with them the next day; just to check in and see how they were doing. Since she was arrested on a night when I was on duty, I knew I needed to follow-up with a call in the morning. I got her cell phone number and I called a few times, but there was no answer. I also called her room phone, but again, there was no answer. I decided since she wasn&rsquo;t answering, I would take a walk over to her residence hall. When I arrived at the residence hall, I found her room and knocked on her door. Her roommate answered the door. I asked if the student was there and the roommate said, &ldquo;No. I haven&rsquo;t seen her since last night. She was going to a party, but I haven&rsquo;t seen her since she left for the party.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Hmmm. That&rsquo;s really odd because Campus Public Safety informed me that the student was brought back to campus.&rdquo; I then called Public Safety and they informed me that the student had been brought back to the hall at 2:20 a.m. I thought this was a bit odd. The student had been brought back to her hall and now wasn&rsquo;t anywhere to be found. No one had seen her and she still wasn&rsquo;t answering her cell phone. At this point, I did what most normal people would do, I went into detective mode trying to find the missing student. Luckily, at this institution, we were able to view the security cameras from the building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I viewed the footage, I clearly saw Public Safety bring the student back and take her to her room. I watched the camera for another 5-10 minutes and then saw the student exit her room and exit the building. I thought, &ldquo;Hmm. Maybe she went to a friend&rsquo;s dorm.&rdquo; I went back and talked to the roommate again and the roommate said, &ldquo;No, she doesn&rsquo;t have any friends in another building.&rdquo; Now I was really worried! I called Public Safety again and they suggested that I call the borough police. Fortunately, when I called the borough police, they had the information I needed. They said they had located this student in the early morning hours. She was still drunk and now, not only had she been arrested by Campus Public Safety, she was later arrested by the borough police. The borough police informed me that the student was currently in the hospital. Her parents were trying to make their way across the state to get her. While I was on the phone with the police, I received a call from the student in the hospital. She said, &ldquo;Hello. Who is this?&rdquo; I informed her as to why I had been calling; to make sure she was okay. I asked her, &ldquo;Do you remember what took place last night?&rdquo; The student replied, &ldquo;I remember going to a party and then I woke up in the hospital.&rdquo; As the student and I talked, we tried to put the pieces together and we figured out that she had been drugged. That&#39;s another issue that comes up with students drinking on or off campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be aware of your surroundings! Safety should be a priority. Know who you&rsquo;re drinking with and know who you&rsquo;re hanging out with. A good safety tip for students who choose to drink: keep your drink with you at all times. Don&rsquo;t ever accept an open drink from someone, pour it yourself.&nbsp; When the student from the last story ended up in the hospital, they did a toxicology test and while her BAC was high, there was another drug in her system. It was determined that she was definitely drugged. It&rsquo;s a tough way to learn a lesson. She just wanted to go out and have some fun, which she should be doing in college. She never expected, at the end of the night, she would end up drugged. Make sure you know who you&#39;re partying with and where you&rsquo;re partying because not everybody will have your best interest in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, we&rsquo;re just trying to keep your children to be as safe as possible. We hear a lot of people say, &ldquo;Well it&#39;s okay, just sleep it off.&rdquo; Sometimes sleeping it off is not the best option for a student. If they&#39;re so intoxicated that they sleep it off in a strange place, that could be dangerous. If they&rsquo;re sleeping it off and are laying the wrong way and they vomit and choke, that&rsquo;s definitely dangerous. Use common sense if you have to sleep it off. Better yet, surround yourself with people you trust and this won&rsquo;t be an issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re a student and you&#39;re reading this, where do you get help if you need it? Let&rsquo;s say you&#39;re too drunk and you don&#39;t know what to do. Call Public Safety or go to the counseling center. Most campuses have safety boxes located throughout the campus. You can press the button on one of these boxes and immediately get some help. If you need a list of other resources, your institutions can provide a list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember a student at one institution that I worked at who was so drunk that she pressed the emergency box button and was talking to Public Safety about how drunk she was and how much fun she had at the party. Unfortunately, she called Public Safety on herself, but at least she was safe and got help. She didn&rsquo;t mean to call Public Safety; she just saw a beautiful light that was flashing when she pressed the button. Lucky for her, Public Safety was able to find her within thirty seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember the story I told you about the girl who peed her pants? Well let me tell you, that is not the only peeing situation I&rsquo;ve been privy to. I don&rsquo;t know why this is an issue, but it is. Students are peeing and not in the bathroom where it belongs! I remember these two roommates who were fighting because one of the roommates would get so drunk and then come home and just pee all over his roommate&rsquo;s stuff. Now, raise your hands with me, right now, if you would be absolutely furious if you came home and all your belongings were wet and smelled like pee? That&rsquo;s why these two roommates had beef. The first time it happened, I was able to bring the two roommates in for a talk, we discussed the situation and cleared it up. When it happened for the 2nd and 3rd time, it wasn&rsquo;t as easy to resolve the situation. At that point, as a resident director, I had to try to figure out the best solution for this situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That same day, I had another situation with a student in another hall who also had a roommate who was peeing on all of their stuff. The funniest part of the peeing situations, was the solution that we ended up with. We brought all four students together for a discussion. It was decided to put the two students who were peeing on their roommate&rsquo;s stuff, in the same room&hellip;together; that way they could swap swords and not bother anyone else. I remember one night, after putting the peeing roommates together, one of the roommates peed on their new peeing roommate&rsquo;s stuff. He later came back to me and said, &ldquo;You know Justin, I can totally understand why my old roommate was so upset with me. Now my stuff got peed on last night and it was not cool!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Yeah. You all are going to have to make better decisions and choices about what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I haven&#39;t told you before, I&#39;m a resident director on a university campus. I live and work on a campus. I oversee a building of 700 students. It is a very fascinating job and life! It&rsquo;s like being in a nature documentary. You get to observe students&rsquo; living habits, eating habits, bathing and hygiene habits, and (brief shudder) mating habits. I even get to see some of their tribal rituals &ndash; meaning when their herd moves. Essentially, that&#39;s on a Thirsty Thursday when I see a group of 60 students all leaving the building at one time, at 11:00pm...with their backpacks on. I guess they are going to the library and I&rsquo;m witnessing their migration patterns. Being a resident director and living amongst the students has been one of the most beneficial opportunities presented to me. You get to see your student&rsquo;s development from the first day that they move in, until they leave. The students that leave are so much different then the students that first arrived. Being a resident director is an extremely interesting job; every day is guaranteed to be different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another trend that I&rsquo;m seeing is the college alcohol culture creating issues for students once they graduate. We&rsquo;re starting to see that some of our students are drinking so much while they&rsquo;re in college that they&rsquo;re becoming full-fledged alcoholics. Once they graduate, their habits and behaviors just continue. I have a friend who has been sober for about three years now, but she had a huge issue with alcohol that started in college. Here she was, out in the adult world and alcohol had become a real problem in her life. In her mind, Thursday, Friday and Saturday were drinking days. Now, out of college, she had a job and worked on Friday&rsquo;s. This meant she couldn&rsquo;t drink hard on Thursday nights if she wanted to get up for work on time the next morning. She had trouble with this because for four years, that was her behavior; Thursday, Friday, Saturday = drink time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can clearly see that these behaviors can have long term effects. Students are unable to smoothly transition back into reality and more importantly, into functional young adult reality. A reality where drinking every day isn&rsquo;t an option and even drinking heavily on the weekends may not be a feasible option. Life changes; jobs happen. There are family and friends to think about and responsibilities to take care of. Not to mention that as you get older, your drinking habits will change organically. You won&rsquo;t be able to &ldquo;hang&rdquo; as long or as often and you probably won&rsquo;t be able to drink as much.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are other factors that come into play when we&rsquo;re talking about alcohol. Alcohol dependency can be an issue for students. They may drink to cope with stress or depression or even homesickness. Like any coping mechanism, this can result in dependency. Using alcohol to mask or lessen certain feelings that they don&rsquo;t know how to handle can end badly. Alcohol may seem like an easy solution, but it&rsquo;s not. In today&rsquo;s campus culture, there are a variety of programs and options on how to deal with stress, depression and anxiety. Most people aren&rsquo;t taught how to cope with stress and they end up looking for a quick fix. They&#39;re not looking to try yoga or meditation to improve the situation. They&rsquo;re not thinking about exercise, activity or eating right; all methods on helping ease stress, depression and anxiety. They&rsquo;re turning to alcohol, to numb the pain, instead. Coping mechanisms aren&rsquo;t really taught at a young age. As a child or young adult, you are sure to pick up on ways that others handle situations, but until you&rsquo;re in that stressful situation, you don&rsquo;t really know how you&rsquo;ll handle it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this culture, some people don&#39;t even recognize alcohol as an issue. I remember walking into a residence hall once with a dad and a son on move-in day who were sitting back, enjoying a drink together; like it was the most normal and natural ending to move-in day. When I spoke with the son, and unfortunately the police, about the situation and why it wasn&rsquo;t okay on campus, the father had an issue with it. He said, &ldquo;How can you fine my son for this? This is a tradition. My grandfather drank with my dad before he started college and my dad drank with me before I started college; this is what I&#39;m doing with my son.&rdquo; We then had to explain the details of the university student code of conduct. I also said to him, &ldquo;I&#39;m sorry, the behaviors you&#39;re exhibiting right now and your support of under-age drinking, is just unacceptable.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not about shaming people, it&rsquo;s more about informing people so they can make better decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of shaming, let&rsquo;s talk about the &ldquo;walk of shame&rdquo; or the &ldquo;stride of pride.&rdquo; These terms and behaviors are popular among students. Some students drink and then don&#39;t want to leave and go back to their residence hall. If you think about this in regard to safety, it isn&rsquo;t actually a bad thing. If you&#39;re going to drink and there&rsquo;s an option to stay the night, stay! If you drank too much, instead of trying to make your way back to your hall drunk, sleep it off, wake up the next morning and go home then. Attempting to get home while intoxicated could increase your chances of injury and definitely increases your risk level when it comes to being involved in a negative alcohol related situation. Not sure if staying put for the night classifies as a walk of shame, but it&rsquo;s certainly worth mentioning. When it comes to the walk of shame or the stride of pride, you should know that when you come back to campus, people will judge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember at one of the institutions I worked at, my on-campus residence had a porch. On Saturday mornings, I would get up really early and I would make breakfast or buy donuts and I would sit on my porch and watch the students coming home from the night before. I would talk to them and ask things like,&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey, how was your night last night?&rdquo; People would come up and talk to me and reply, &ldquo;Man, last night was crazy!!!&rdquo; I would say, &ldquo;Hey, looks like you had a rough night, would you like a donut?&rdquo; Some people wouldn&rsquo;t speak to me at all, but they would give me the middle finger. Some people would just say, &ldquo;That smells really good; can I have some?&rdquo; I would reply, &ldquo;Yeah, of course.&rdquo; People would come over and chat. I would buy enough hot chocolate and donuts for everybody to enjoy. That was my opportunity to talk to students about what they were up to and the decisions they were making. Drinking alcohol doesn&rsquo;t make you a bad person. This chapter isn&rsquo;t meant to be pro-alcohol or anti-alcohol, it&rsquo;s meant to give people a general idea about alcohol from both sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I could meet with students in a non-disciplinary setting, students might be able to trust me more when it comes to having those real intentional conversations about alcohol, I feel like I could make a bigger difference. As far as disciplinary situations, some students have no remorse. Most of the time when students are coming to me for judicial conferences, they&#39;re sitting with me and they&#39;re talking to me; saying things like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even care.&rdquo; If I ask them if they&rsquo;re going to drink again, they usually reply, &ldquo;Yeah, most likely.&rdquo; I try to give tips and for some students, they really soak up all the information I give them; other students, they simply don&#39;t care. They say, &ldquo;I&#39;m just going to do my time. I&#39;m not going to get caught.&rdquo; Look, I get it. You&rsquo;re a young adult. You&rsquo;re trying to make your own decisions. You&rsquo;re trying to be your own person. Sometimes bending the law, but not necessarily breaking the law, can be thrilling and exciting. We really want students to avoid situations that result in judicial conferences. Our hope is that students want to make better choices and to be responsible, while having fun. If students can do this, they&#39;ll have a much better experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few tips for students and parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tips for students:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be yourself! If you&#39;re going into school right now, you might not know yourself yet, but you will soon. I actually know some adults who still don&#39;t know themselves. Being in college is the perfect time to figure out who you are and who you want to be and why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow the law! Laws are set for a reason. Look, as someone who occasionally likes to do things that technically bend the law to have fun, I&rsquo;m telling you that the law is put in place for a reason and shouldn&rsquo;t be broken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drink wisely! We&rsquo;ve talked about this throughout the chapter. Make sure that you&#39;re not doing things that are going to be detrimental to you now or in your future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be smart! Rely on your friends. If you can&#39;t rely on your friends, rely on public safety. I&rsquo;m sure some people are thinking, &ldquo;Why would I ever call public safety or the police on myself? That&rsquo;s crazy!&rdquo; At the end the day, you never want to be in a situation that turns bad, if you can help it. If you are an intentional bystander and can get someone the help they need, do it! In some states, they have an amnesty clause where if you call the police to help someone and you were also drinking, there won&rsquo;t be negative ramifications for you. Honestly, we just want the students to have fun but also have a life the next day. It&rsquo;s pretty important that you do your part to ensure that everybody&rsquo;s being safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Unfortunately, some students have to learn the hard way. I&#39;m going to say this, &ldquo;DON&rsquo;T LEARN THE HARD WAY!&rdquo; Every student thinks it&rsquo;s not going to be them; it may be them, it might be YOU! It may have already been you and you&rsquo;re reminiscing right now as I tell these stories. You may be thinking to yourself, &ldquo;Man, if I could do this over.&rdquo; or &ldquo;If I had just done this, I wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten caught!&rdquo; or &ldquo;If I had just stayed put, Public Safety wouldn&rsquo;t have picked me up.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t have to be so difficult! You know the rules, you know the policies so try to abide by them. If you&rsquo;re going to break the rules, be smart about it. Have good friends that will be there to tell you when you&rsquo;re out of hand. Ask an upperclassmen, they&#39;ll tell you the rules and tricks to make sure that you&#39;re safe and you&#39;re drinking responsibly. Your friends should be the ones that are around you when you&#39;re drinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now for those individuals who want to have fun and drink alcohol and you&rsquo;re not phased by anything I&rsquo;ve said, that&rsquo;s okay, I didn&rsquo;t write this to scare you. This chapter was meant to provide information for everyone and from both sides. I know a lot of people who go out, have a few drinks and that&rsquo;s it; it&#39;s all good. They go home and they get up in the morning like nothing happened. That&rsquo;s responsible drinking. If more people could do that, it would be perfect. Nothing&rsquo;s wrong with getting a little buzz on! Nothing&#39;s wrong with you going out and having a good time. Nothing&#39;s wrong with any of that, if you&#39;re of legal drinking age of course. Nothing&rsquo;s wrong if you&rsquo;re being safe and making sure you&rsquo;re paying attention and are aware of your surroundings. There&rsquo;s nothing worse than endangering your life or someone else&#39;s life due to your stupidity. What I want you to get out of this chapter is that alcohol could be your best friend or it could be your worst enemy; it&rsquo;s up to you to decide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tips for parents:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parents, BE PARENTS! That means you can&rsquo;t break the law at home and then be upset with your child when they go to school and break the law and get in trouble. That just doesn&rsquo;t make sense! Don&rsquo;t be upset with school administrators when we&#39;ve provided you with the student code of conduct and explained the ramifications of not following the policies. The rules and policies are there for a reason. I get &ldquo;millions&rdquo; of calls from parents that are upset that we&#39;re enforcing the university policy, even though the students have signed off on a document saying that they&#39;re aware of and are going to follow university policies. Parents, back us up! Let&rsquo;s be on the same page and send the same message to your child. Being parents means that, unfortunately, sometimes you&#39;re going to have to make the unpopular choice. You&rsquo;re going to have to take a stand, just like we, as student affairs professionals, have to take a stand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parents, encourage your son or daughter to tell the truth! It&#39;s going to be hard for your son or daughter to come and talk to you about these things. Why? They don&#39;t want to be in trouble with their parents. They don&#39;t want to disappoint their parents. They don&#39;t want to feel the shame of having to tell their parents they have a $300.00 fine, they have to go through alcohol-related classes and complete classwork modules that deal with alcohol education and awareness. That&rsquo;s a horrible thing for a child to have to tell their parent. If your child comes to talk to you about what they&#39;ve done or something they haven&rsquo;t done, please be understanding; reacting in anger is not going to help them. In fact, it&#39;s going to reinforce the behavior and then they&rsquo;re probably not going to tell you the full situation now or in any future situation. I&rsquo;m not saying don&rsquo;t be upset, but make sure that you lend them an ear because this is a pivotal point in your child&rsquo;s life. Hear them out. They just want to be validated. They want to be understood. They want to know that they can go to you, their parent, and be certain that they are going to be heard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your son or daughter incurs a fine or legal trouble, take the situation for what it is. Some parents actually immediately try to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the situation and that&rsquo;s why their child doesn&rsquo;t fear the law. They know their parents are going to fix it. My suggestion to parents would be: let your students take care of their infraction by themselves. They got the infraction by themselves, or they got the policy violation by themselves, allow them to fix it by themselves. This is the only way that they can possibly learn from the experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your son or daughter is going to let you down while they&#39;re in school. Except it! Prepare for it! They may let you down by failing a class or not performing well on a test, not choosing the major you want them to choose or by getting in trouble with some type of policy infraction. We&rsquo;re all human, that&rsquo;s what we do; we let each other down. We&#39;re not perfect, or at least some of us aren&rsquo;t. We&#39;re all works in progress. This is the time for them to make mistakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ages 18-22 can determine the trajectory of what your child is going to do for the rest of their lives. Give them an opportunity to fail. Give them the space to make mistakes, that&#39;s where the greatest learning takes place. Most importantly, please support us as university officials. We&rsquo;re not out to get your child. We&rsquo;re not out to get them in trouble and penalize them. If anything, we&#39;re upset, just like you&rsquo;re upset. You&#39;re upset because your child has to pay fines and is in trouble with the law. We&rsquo;re upset because we have more work to do! Listen, we don&rsquo;t go out of our way to find trouble, trust me, trouble finds us. If we support each other, the situation doesn&rsquo;t have to go from bad to worse.</p>', '2020-09-07 23:15:06', '2020-09-11 00:01:46', NULL);

(24, 6, 'drugs vs. DRUGS', NULL, 20, '<p>You can&rsquo;t have a chapter about alcohol and not follow it up with a chapter about drugs! Drugs are just as prevalent on college campuses as alcohol. People always look at me with this glazed look in their eyes when I say that. Like it&#39;s impossible for drugs to be as prevalent as alcohol on college campuses. Don&#39;t believe me? Remember the story I told you about back in Chapter 1? The story about the questions asked by a university official, to both parents and students during orientation? Let me refresh your memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before school begins, freshman orientation is held for both for parents and students. The rules and policies of the campus are explained and a tour of the campus is given. They taste the food in the university dining hall, get to meet their professors for their classes and find out all of the fun stuff that&#39;s going to be happening on campus. During the orientation, a university official asked an audience of about 350 students, &ldquo;How many of you drink?&rdquo; Only 1 or 2 students raised their hands. The university administrator then said to the students, &ldquo;Come on, I&rsquo;m not stupid. I&#39;ve been working at the University for twenty years now, let&#39;s just be honest; no one&#39;s going to get in trouble. I just want to get a clear and honest poll for how many people drink. So, I&rsquo;ll ask you again, &ldquo;How many of you in this room drink?&rdquo; When the university official stated it that way, 80% of the first year students raised their hands. She said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great! This is cool, we&rsquo;re all being honest now.&rdquo; Then the university official asked the audience, &ldquo;How many of you do drugs?&rdquo; Of course, no one raised their hand. So she stated again, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just be honest here. It&rsquo;s okay, no one is going to get in trouble. Just raise your hand.&rdquo; When she phrased the question that way, about 70% of the first year students raised their hands. Then the university administrator said, &ldquo;How many of you smoke marijuana?&rdquo;&nbsp; When she asked this question, the majority of the room raised their hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the students were done, the parents came in for their portion of orientation. The administrator said, &ldquo;How many of you know that your child or student participates in drinking alcohol? Raise your hand if you do.&rdquo; Only a few parents raised their hand. The administrator repeated the question, but received the same raised hands. The administrator then said, &ldquo;This is so interesting because 80% of the students who were just in here, said they drink alcohol.&rdquo; The parents were shocked. Then the administrator said, &ldquo;How many of you know that your students do drugs or smoke marijuana?&rdquo; Of course, the parents didn&rsquo;t raise their hands&hellip;again. Then the administrator said to them, &ldquo;You know 70% of the students that were in here said they did.&rdquo; The look of shock and utter disbelief on their parents&#39; faces was priceless.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The enormous disconnect between students and their parents is a major factor that motivated and inspired me to write this book. Drugs, and the potential use of drugs is an intense topic, but it&rsquo;s a topic that should be seriously discussed and not just discussed once. Parents and students should be having ongoing conversations about drugs and discuss it continuously. Drugs are a huge issue in the world, on college campuses across the country and in high schools as well. We all know it&rsquo;s a problem, yet conversations, between parents and kids, still aren&rsquo;t happening. Yes, students are doing drugs when they go to college. Sometimes they&rsquo;re experimenting with drugs, solely out of curiosity, sometimes they&rsquo;re doing drugs to fit in or maybe they see their peers doing it or some may even use drugs as a coping mechanism for issues they&rsquo;re dealing with or in an attempt to regulate a chemical imbalance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a previous chapter, we talked about students coming to campuses with their suitcase full of issues. We also talked about alcohol being an issue. Unfortunately, for some students, alcohol isn&rsquo;t enough. They want to do something that&rsquo;s a little bit harder; and drugs may be the option that they choose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that some students don&rsquo;t just come to college for an education? Some students actually come to college so they can sell drugs. Yes, there are dealers, in college and they&rsquo;re selling drugs. You might be asking yourself why would a dealer spend all that money so that they can come to college? Think about it, there are a bevy of customers at their beck and call. The dealers know exactly where the customers are and students know where the dealers are. The dealers can go directly to a student&rsquo;s dorm room or they can set up a purchase/deliver system so that students can purchase drugs. Dealers are even wearing special clothes so students know who to go to for drugs. Everyone knows, look for this individual, wearing these clothes in this specific location. I mean imagine, if you go to a school that costs $20,000 a year to attend, and you&rsquo;re a dealer, you could probably make the $20,000 back within a few months and now you&rsquo;re actually making pure profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People don&rsquo;t believe me, but drug dealers are a REAL thing on college campuses. It&rsquo;s happening more and more nowadays. In this day and age, I think most universities are being vigilant in their fight against drugs being sold and used on campus. There are major consequences if someone is caught selling drugs on campus. They will be disqualified as a student and more importantly, they will face criminal charges. There are certain times throughout the school year where the dealers are more readily available to their customers. In my experience, the most prevalent time for deals happening on campus is right around midterms and finals weeks. In addition to regular street drugs, dealers also sell prescription drugs (obviously, prescribed to other people). Dealers capitalize on selling drugs that enhance the ability to focus, like Ritalin or Adderall. Since extra focus may be needed during heavy test times, this is a prime opportunity for the dealers to make even more money. During the regular school year, students are sometimes using marijuana, meth, cocaine and heroin, depending on the area your school is located.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we go back to the previous story, at orientation, what we find is that often times parents aren&rsquo;t aware of the activities their students are participating in. When the college administrator in the orientation story asks the parents, &ldquo;How many of your students do drugs?&rdquo; And the parents look around thinking, &ldquo;Not my child.&rdquo; We find that a lot of parents have this &ldquo;not my child&rdquo; mindset, meaning &ldquo;It&#39;s impossible for my child to do this. My child hasn&#39;t done it in front of me so I know they haven&#39;t done it.&rdquo; What parents have to realize is that their students don&#39;t do everything in front of you. Your child will change. The child you sent away to college is not the same one that you may be getting when they come home. Children evolve, they develop, they learn new habits and just because your child had or hasn&#39;t done something in front of you doesn&#39;t mean that they do it or don&rsquo;t do it. This is why we need to have these engaging conversations with our students to really know what&#39;s going on in their culture and their lives. We need to understand that students are making decisions and that&#39;s what life&#39;s all about. It&#39;s about making a decision: &ldquo;yes, I&#39;m going to do this&rdquo; or &ldquo;no, I&#39;m not going to do this.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, we can&#39;t hold the student&rsquo;s hands. When I go back to the story about the student who was dealing to afford college, it seems unfortunate, but she was making a choice and she knew that selling drugs was against university policies. She knew that it was going against the student code of conduct but she made the decision to continue selling drugs. The outcome of that story was that the university chose to remove the student from the institution. I recall talking to her parent about the situation and the parent just could not believe that their precious student had been selling drugs. How could this have happened? I tried giving the parent some insight, asking, &ldquo;Were you and your spouse recently divorced?&rdquo; The parent said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Did you know that had a really big effect on your daughter?&rdquo; The parent was in shock. They weren&rsquo;t aware of the long-term effects that their situation could have on their daughter. The parent began to cry and we had a long developmental conversation concerning where her daughter might be going, because she needed some different options for her future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For students who are reading this, I want you to know that people who are dealing drugs on campus usually get caught. Sometimes they don&#39;t, but most of the time, they do. Your university police are working overtime to find these individuals who are committing these infractions on your campuses. This is not something you want to be involved in; this is something you want to stay far away from. Look, some of you who are reading might already be doing drugs or even selling drugs. If that describes you, if you have the ability, get out now! One of the reasons I say that is because what we&rsquo;re finding is that students who are turning in the dealers are also turning in other students. If you&#39;re involved in something like this, get out as soon as you can; nothing good can come from this situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When people are trying drugs for the first or second time, they don&rsquo;t really know what to expect. The only thing they have to base their reaction off of is what others have told them. Since they don&rsquo;t have any personal experience, their reaction is almost solely based off of other people&#39;s perception of what the drug <em>should</em> do. People sharing their personal reactions is almost subliminal to a new drug user. They&rsquo;re going to expect that same feeling or reaction, but your experience can be completely different from someone else&rsquo;s. Everyone experiences drugs and being high in many different ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peer pressure has and probably always will be a huge factor when it comes to doing drugs. You may hear people may say, &ldquo;Smoke this joint; it&rsquo;ll make you feel good! Being high is great, it makes the college experience better.&rdquo; Most times when we talk to students about their experiences, they say they did it because they wanted to give it the old college try. I&#39;m sure a lot of you who have been through college can recall your own situations where you just wanted to give it the college try. Was it the best decision? If you were a little bit more mature, would you have made the same decisions that you made or would you have chosen something different? How do you advise your son or daughter who&#39;s about to enter college? Would you tell them to give it a try because you did? Again, some people like to learn things the hard way; the School of Hard Knocks. For other people, they don&rsquo;t want to learn that way; they&rsquo;d rather <em>not </em>be exposed to certain things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drug use in students has escalated from the lower level, more common drugs (like marijuana) to hard core drugs (PCP, heroin, meth, cocaine). I don&rsquo;t want to promote the use of any drug, but I consider marijuana to be on the same level as alcohol. Taking prescription narcotic drugs can have negative, long-term effects on your body and your mind. It&rsquo;s even more dangerous when they&rsquo;re prescribed to someone else. First, do you really know what they are? Second, do you know what dosage to take? Lastly, you should never take drugs that are not prescribed to you. Drugs like meth, cocaine, and heroin are considered hardcore. If you or someone you know is using these drugs in a long-term situation, not only is there risk of being addicted to the drug, but you could have severe physical repercussions from using, such as, respiratory failure, heart failure, loss of teeth, and/or physical deterioration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember one time in a residence hall, at the institution I used to work for, where we had to do room checks. Room checks take place when we need to ensure that the students are being safe in their rooms. This means that we&rsquo;re checking to make sure that their rooms are clean, the trash is taken out, making sure there is no mold, mildew, bugs or any other safety concerns that could put the students at risk. Most institutions do about two health and safety checks per semester. These are conducted by the resident director or the resident assistants that are in the building. I recall this one time I had to do a health and safety check in a room. When I walked into the room, right in plain view, sitting on the desk, was a scale, some marijuana and some empty baggies. I asked the roommate, &ldquo;Excuse me? What is all this?&rdquo; The roommate looked me right in my face and said, &ldquo;Hey look. I don&rsquo;t want anything to do with this. I&rsquo;m not involved in this but it&rsquo;s definitely my roommate&rsquo;s. I don&#39;t have anything to do with this.&rdquo; I asked the roommate, &ldquo;How long has this been going on?&rdquo; The roommate replied, &ldquo;All year!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As most people in this position would do, I called Public Safety. They came to the room and confiscated all of the drug paraphernalia. A few days later, I had to talk to the student, in a judicial meeting, about the events that took place. The student started crying. She told me that she had to sell drugs because her parents had just gotten divorced and this was the only way she could afford to go to school. This isn&#39;t to paint any drug dealers in a positive light. I just always, in every single text, want to give both sides of the story. That particular student didn&rsquo;t intend to be a drug dealer. She was just trying to make some money and didn&#39;t realize the bigger effect this could have on her future or the student body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students are consuming drugs and alcohol in a variety of new and different ways. I know some students who didn&rsquo;t want to get in trouble for drinking so they soaked all of their vodka into gummy bears. So, it appeared that they were just eating gummy bears, but in reality, they were getting drunk. Some students are even taking prescription pills in ways they were not designed to be taken. For example: Students have been known to crush up a pill, and snort it; instead of taking it the way it was intended. It just looks different today than in past years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember a story about a young man at the institution I used to work at. He consumed what he thought was a pot brownie, but the pot brownie was laced with ecstasy and he wasn&rsquo;t aware. And of course, because he didn&rsquo;t know the brownies were laced, he hadn&rsquo;t just eaten one; he had eaten several. We found this student later on, praying in the middle of the street in a surrounding local city; all because he was under the influence of an unknown drug. Later on, we found the individual making very weird remarks to some of the students in the hall. He was talking to some of the residents and asking them to go look at his poop. He wanted everyone to come look at his poop in the toilet. Of course, people thought his behavior was extremely odd and it was, because he was high. Ultimately, his parents had to come and get him and he had to get a toxicology test. That pot brownie had a huge impact on his life. He ended up having to transfer schools due to the severe effects the drugs had on him. This situation was horrible. He didn&#39;t know the pot brownie was laced with other drugs because the dealer didn&#39;t tell him. It&rsquo;s not safe to take drugs from people you don&rsquo;t know. Make smart decisions when it comes to drugs because drugs can really mess you up; whether it&rsquo;s becoming addicted or having an adverse reaction to something you weren&rsquo;t even aware you took.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we talk about drug addiction or drug dependency, some students can develop drug issues while in school. Unfortunately, when they go home for Thanksgiving break, holiday/Christmas break or Spring break, of course, the dependency goes with them. For parents, if your child comes home and they&rsquo;re acting a little odd or not acting like themselves, pay attention; better to be safe than sorry. Yes, your son or daughter will be somewhat different because they&rsquo;re in college; they&rsquo;re used to a bit of independence. But you should still recognize your child! Am I saying every single student who comes home has a drug dependency? NO! Of course not. I don&rsquo;t want your child to come home for break, walk through the door and have you sniffing and searching through their bags like Batman screaming, WHERE ARE THE DRUGS!?! That is not what I&rsquo;m suggesting at all. What I am suggesting is that if you see a significant behavioral change in your child there might be some questions that you might want to ask. Things may have changed and things may be a little different but it&rsquo;s up to you to play your role as parents and really pay attention to see if these things are extremely different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes college campuses have a huge drug bust and everyone sits around puzzled thinking, &ldquo;How could this happen on our campus? How could this ever take place?&rdquo; Well, it would be fair to say that most college campuses have a dealer, who has a lot of inventory and he or she is ready to come in to sell their supply! This scenario isn&rsquo;t just prone to certain areas. There are drugs and alcohol on every single campus. I remember at the institution of a friend of mine there was an almost one-million-dollar drug bust! When you think about this, what 20 year old has a million dollars&rsquo; worth of drugs? It happens though. You can look it up on the Internet and see that there are a lot of busts in different situations on different campuses around the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They&rsquo;re also becoming more creative. Some of these drugs are labeled with emoji&rsquo;s or labeled with your favorite icon. They don&#39;t even look like drugs, they look like candy. They can be any type of drug too. Then there are the date rape drugs being slipped into drinks and when the drug actually fully dissolves, the drink still appears the same as it was originally. It doesn&#39;t even look like the drink has been tampered with. You can&#39;t just go by what your eye sees; your eyes aren&rsquo;t going to see that the drink was messed with. You can&rsquo;t even go by your taste, because a lot of the drugs are even tasteless. Be cautious about what you are considering putting in your body. Something that may seem as harmless as a piece of candy, may be more than you bargained for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes we even catch people bringing in drugs on move-in day. As a resident director, you hope that you only catch maybe a hamster, a cat or a little dog being moved into the residence hall, but on some occasions, we actually do catch students moving in and bringing drugs with them. Then we have to have a really awkward conversation with the student and their parents about why the student is going back home on move-in day and why they won&rsquo;t be attending school there. You see a whole bunch of ad campaigns about drugs. Some of the more familiar ones are: dontdoit.com or dontknowyourfacts.com. You could also try justthinktwice.gov or getsmartaboutdrugs.gov. They have these drug ads for a reason, not just to be corny. Some of them are very corny but they&rsquo;re trying to get the message out there that drugs have long-lasting effects and can be really harmful to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to leave you all with tips for parents and students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parents:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have an open dialogue with your child about drugs. It&rsquo;s a real thing. You may have even done drugs in the past but to blindly assume that your student doesn&#39;t know anything about drugs, that they&rsquo;re not involved with drugs, or that your student doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with drugs is ludicrous. Drugs have become almost a normalized part of society, so continue to have engaging conversations with our children, to discuss these uncomfortable issues. It&rsquo;s going to be uncomfortable and you&rsquo;re not going to feel cool. Your child may even give you some pretty generic answers saying they don&rsquo;t do drugs or haven&rsquo;t tried drugs and won&rsquo;t be doing drugs in the future. Ask the important questions. Their answers will probably be no. But press on. Tell them openly and honestly, &ldquo;If you&#39;re going to try drugs, I need you to be safe. If you&#39;re going to try drugs, try to stick to the milder drugs. The hard-core drugs can have life-altering effects. I don&rsquo;t want you to get hurt. I don&rsquo;t want to lose you. I care about you.&rdquo; Those conversations are more important than you saying to your child, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do drugs!&rdquo; From day one, that&rsquo;s what the students hear: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do drugs or alcohol.&rdquo; Does it stop them from doing it? No! If we told our students: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t skateboard down the steps in a residence hall&rdquo; do you think that stops them? No! We tell students: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pee on the statue in the middle of the quad.&rdquo; Does it stop them? No! Why? Because just telling students not to do something isn&rsquo;t enough for the students to get those elemental learning pieces to <em>not </em>do something. Think about it yourself, how many times has an authority figure told you not to do something and you continue to do it anyway?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, as someone who does diversity training and speaks to students all the time, I&#39;m telling you that I don&#39;t particularly break the law but there are sometimes I like to bend the rules. I might go to a Philadelphia Eagles game and sneak into the locker room so I can take pictures with all the players...true story! I may sneak into the N.F.L draft and meet Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner&hellip;again, true story! You know, sometimes, bending the law works (Disclaimer: Don&rsquo;t break the law). The things I&rsquo;m referring to aren&rsquo;t safety issues. When it comes to the consumption of alcohol and drugs, these behaviors can be detrimental to your life and set you going backwards on your life&rsquo;s trajectory; which is to be a successful student at a university or college. We know you want to follow your dreams, make them come true and make your parents proud. Drugs and alcohol are not the way to do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back to parent&rsquo;s tips:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parents, be aware of what the effects of drugs look like. Your child could have extreme personality changes, loss of appetite, huge changes in sleeping patterns, depression, withdrawal from family members, carelessness of personal hygiene, lack of interest in hobbies, etc. Look up the symptoms if you are not sure. Pay attention and if you know that your son or daughter is doing drugs, get them the help that they need. Standing back thinking that they&rsquo;ll figure it out or waiting for them get the help on their own&hellip;not a good idea. Some people have drug dependency and they truly need someone to advocate for them. That means being a parent, stepping in when your child doesn&#39;t want you to, being invasive and making sure your student gets the assistance and resources that they need to be the most successful student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m pro-drugs, I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m anti-drugs, but, based on my experiences, I would say that using drugs, consuming drugs, inhaling drugs, snorting drugs and shooting up drugs has never been something where I&#39;ve witnessed a positive outcome. Yeah, that high might feel good but it&rsquo;s only a temporary feeling. Yeah, that high might take you to a place where you can escape your pain, but again, that&rsquo;s just temporary. You don&rsquo;t want a temporary fix to become a permanent solution or outcome.&nbsp; Most of the time, the pain of things that you&rsquo;re going through or stressful situations that you may encounter are just momentary. You figure out how to deal with them, how to cope with them, how to get through them, how to be a better person in spite of them. Whatever doesn&#39;t kill you makes you stronger! Sometimes, the thing that you&rsquo;re doing isn&rsquo;t killing you now but will eventually kill you. Make sure you are making the best decisions possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was growing up, the majority of advice I got regarding drugs was to stay away from them, don&rsquo;t be involved with people who are using them. I&rsquo;ve known friends and colleagues that may not have been doing drugs themselves but were around people who were doing drugs. They ended up getting caught up in situations that were violent, where individuals got robbed, stabbed, or beat up just because they were in association with individuals who did drugs. The advice I always got was: stay as far away from it as possible. If you see drugs, go in the opposite direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just because you&#39;re reading this book doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to be able to influence you. I will say this: I&#39;m not going to be there when you&#39;re doing drugs, your parents probably won&rsquo;t be there when you&rsquo;re doing drugs, so the best person to look out for you is YOU. Drugs weren&rsquo;t designed to create long-term happiness, only temporary happiness; not a long-term solution to your issue. Your issue could theoretically just be a minor setback or a minor situation. Drugs can ruin lives, waste your money and rob you of time that could be used to achieve your goals in life. Your focus should be on completing a two year Associate&#39;s degree, a four year Master&#39;s degree or aspire to complete a Doctorate degree. Doing drugs will not be a successful addition to your plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with this last story. I had a friend who got caught up in using drugs. It wasn&#39;t cool and I witnessed his downfall. That&#39;s why I&#39;m saying you&#39;ve got to speak up. In this situation, my friend told me he could handle it and I believed him. Instead of being that intentional friend or an active bystander, and having the conversation, he continued on and was kicked out of the institution. Am I saying this so you can judge me and think, &ldquo;Man. Justin was a bad friend. He didn&rsquo;t speak up!&rdquo; No! At that time in my developmental state, I didn&#39;t know that speaking up was an option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I come from a culture that says &ldquo;No Snitching&rdquo; and if your friend said using drugs was okay, then it was okay. You don&#39;t continuously get on your friend about it. But no! If you have friends, colleagues, family or loved ones that you know are on drugs and are not getting the help they need, be that positive and intrusive bystander; help them to help themselves. Sometimes intervention is the only option left. Thankfully, my friend was able to get the help that he needed and he&rsquo;s no longer on drugs. If you ask him, he would tell you that it was a very dark time in his life and if he could do it all over again, he wouldn&rsquo;t do it. Stay away from drugs. If going to college so you can be a dealer or experiment with drugs is on your To Do list, just stay home; you could be a drug dealer and a drug user for free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you or anyone you know need help, there are many local resources available.

(25, 6, 'It’s Called Sex People!', NULL, 20, '<p>Let&#39;s talk about sex baby, let&rsquo;s talk about you and me! All right, most of us already know that sex is definitely taking place in college. If you didn&#39;t know, now you know! Obviously, this book is designed so that you can have open dialogue with your student or parents about a multitude of different topics. Sex can be an awkward conversation to have. It can be awkward talking to your parents about it and it can even be awkward talking to your peers. You thought you escaped another sex talk because you took the class back in your teen years and then you had the birds and bees conversation with your parents. I guess you thought that would be the end of the sex talk. When you go off to college, that&#39;s another opportunity to have a more elevated conversation about sex, since sex is basically embedded in the college experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>College can be a time where people go out and explore their sexuality a little bit deeper or maybe it&rsquo;s a time when you&rsquo;ll encounter your first sexual experience. Mom and dad aren&rsquo;t around and there aren&rsquo;t any rules about men or women coming into your room at any particular time. There&rsquo;s usually no curfew and you just kind of find yourself in predicaments that you previously wouldn&rsquo;t have found yourself in. When I say that sex is rampant on college campuses, I mean sex is rampant! Students are having sex and they&#39;re probably having sex with multiple partners. When you&rsquo;re in college, since you&rsquo;re a little older, you think your relationships are going to be stronger. You have more mature relationships with people. I&rsquo;m talking more mature relationships, in general, not just sexual relationships and not just the casual relationships where you meet up at the mall, to hang out, after your mom drops you off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I walked onto college campuses, for me as a heterosexual, cisgender male, I was shocked. I had seen women, but this was totally different. In high school, there was a dress code, but for the most part, in college, there is no dress code. And I mean NO dress code! When I saw women hanging out in the quad, wearing only bikinis, I was like, &ldquo;Whoa, look at that!&rdquo; Now <em>that </em>was a memorable moment for me. The promiscuity of men and women in college is off the charts. Mom and dad aren&#39;t there telling you to change your clothes. You can pretty much wear whatever you want; you&rsquo;re independent so you can make your own choices. You can basically do whatever you want, wear whatever you want and act however you want. Growing up, most kids were safeguarded against these types of behaviors and experiences. Kids were discouraged from acting a certain way and growing up too fast. Now, they have the ability to go out and behave any way they want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know for the parents who are reading this right now, you&#39;re probably freaking out! You&rsquo;re probably saying, &ldquo;No! Not my son or daughter!&rdquo; or &ldquo;My daughter is a virgin!&rdquo; or &ldquo;My son is practicing celibacy!&rdquo; You won&rsquo;t truly know, unless you talk to your son or daughter. Here&rsquo;s the other thing, you may ask them and they may lie to you. Think about it, would you tell your parents whether or not you&rsquo;re having sex while you&#39;re in college? That&rsquo;s why having open and honest conversations are so important. Rest assured, there are a myriad of sex education programs available on university campuses. One thing that happens at most of these programs is that condoms are given out. This is a good system because you want your kids to practice safe sex. Those free condoms will definitely be put to use!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a myriad of reasons why students are engaging in sexual activity in college. Hormones are raging, it happens; it&rsquo;s part of life. Another reason could be that mom and dad aren&rsquo;t around to tell you not to. Maybe your mom and dad were strict while you were growing up and now they&rsquo;re telling you, &ldquo;When you go to college, don&rsquo;t have sex.&rdquo; Now, all of a sudden, mom and dad aren&rsquo;t there and the urge to experiment and try new things is creeping to the top of your list of &ldquo;stuff to do&rdquo;. True story, when I was visiting colleges, before I made my decision on where to go, I would literally see signs posted, on the road, saying things like, &ldquo;Thank you for your daughters. Welcome to such and such a college!&rdquo; or &ldquo;You were her daddy for 18 years; now I&#39;m her daddy, at least for tonight.&rdquo; I was thinking, &ldquo;Oh my! This is a brand-new trip for me!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some students who are already in college, you&rsquo;ve had a year or two years or possibly three of sexual adventures under your belts. So, when you see new people on campus, like first year students, I&rsquo;m sure it feels like the perfect time to introduce them to the sexual escapades known to college life. Intentional conversations are so important when it comes to going to college in relation to sexual intercourse and sexual promiscuity. Maybe you&rsquo;ve come from a high school that had a small number of students and now you&rsquo;re in an environment where there are a ton of diverse people to discover. There are so many different people, makes, models and genders; it can be a bit overwhelming. College students are having lots of sex with lots of different people and experiencing new adventures. That&rsquo;s why I think the conversations about sexual activity and sexual education are so important. The conversations are also a way to find out the real answers as to why people are having sex. Some people have a sexual addiction; they just need and want sex; like any addiction, it can be all-consuming. College campuses are a place they can feed those sexual desires and cravings to the max. Others are just having fun and enjoying the new-found freedoms they have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal note for me, and I&rsquo;m not embarrassed about it like I used to be, I was celibate in college. I was celibate the entire time. Granted, as a cisgender, heterosexual, black male, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I didn&rsquo;t have urges. It doesn&#39;t mean that I didn&rsquo;t mess around with women; oh I definitely did. But I didn&#39;t have sex. I had a few experiences with some women that were probably the most gorgeous women I&rsquo;ve ever seen, in my entire life and I had the opportunity to have sex with them. Again, it was <em>extremely </em>hard to say no! I was made fun of because people thought that maybe there was something wrong with me or that I was gay, because how else could I say no? &ldquo;That dude is weird&rdquo; or &ldquo;What kind of man are you?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re wondering why I chose to be celibate. It was a personal choice. I made that decision and I stuck to it. I didn&rsquo;t want to give myself up to just anyone. I wanted to make sure the person I decided to be with was special and the person that I would be with was going to be a lifetime person. I wasn&rsquo;t interested in a one night stand. I didn&rsquo;t want to get an STD or get someone pregnant either. For me, it was a no brainer. I found that there weren&rsquo;t many people in college who were celibate and if they were celibate, they certainly weren&#39;t telling people about it. Now that I&rsquo;m an adult, I can sincerely say, for me, it was the best choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m going to tell you some stories about why my choice to remain celibate was a good decision. Being celibate meant I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about contracting an STD; and believe me, some of my friends contracted STDs in college. I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about getting someone pregnant. I didn&#39;t have to worry about having or not having that spiritual and emotional connection with somebody that wasn&#39;t worthy of having those connections with me. Sex is not just a physical connection, it&rsquo;s an emotional and psychological connection as well. Think about how the act of sexual intercourse connects your mind, body and soul. Throughout your life and definitely in college, you have the opportunity to truly get to know people. Remember that the people you meet in college are, at that moment, just like you, trying to figure out who they are. Sometimes the person, standing in front of you, the person you&rsquo;ve been learning about and connecting with, may not actually be the person you think they are. My questions to you would be: Who do you really want to be connected to? Who do you know or want to get to know on that level? What do you really know about the people you&rsquo;ve previously connected with? Are they worthy of you giving them your connection? Think about these questions as you go down the path of sexual adventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many topics to discuss in this chapter and they&rsquo;re all important, but sexual safety is extremely important in college and of course, throughout life. We want to make sure that if students are having sex (and they are definitely having sex!), that they&#39;re being as safe as possible. We want to make sure that they&#39;re using condoms, that all parties involved are consensual, and that, hopefully, they aren&rsquo;t drunk while they&rsquo;re having sex. I&rsquo;m sure some of you are saying, &ldquo;Drunk sex is great sex!&rdquo; That may be true (or not), but let me tell you, when drunk people engage in sex, no one is able to consent. No one is of a sober mind to make a decision to consent. Lack of consent means the action is considered rape. So, technically, any drunk sexual intercourse could and is defined as rape. Be aware of this and make the right decisions. Use condoms to prevent pregnancy and STDs! Don&rsquo;t have drunk sex where consent is absent. These tips shouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult to follow. The consequences of not following them could alter your life, forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have to start teaching what constitutes consent. Think about it, boys are taught: Boys will be boys. But when it comes to consent, that&rsquo;s not acceptable. Rape is rape, people! Sexual assault is sexual assault! It doesn&#39;t matter if she was drunk. It doesn&#39;t matter if she was coming on to you. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if she was wearing a short dress. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if she was acting promiscuously. None of these things matter when it comes to consent. A yes must be a sober yes. In the statements that I just said, it sounds like I&rsquo;m implying that women are the only victims of rape and that&rsquo;s not true. There are men who are raped in college, and in the world, as well. Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t rely on data and statistics for rape against men, because most men don&rsquo;t report rape; especially in a college setting. For some reason, it&rsquo;s looked at as embarrassing. Men don&rsquo;t want to admit that they were raped, but it does happen. When we talk about the data regarding rape, not only do we not have accurate data on men being raped, we don&rsquo;t have accurate data about women being raped either. A good amount of women, who experience rape, don&rsquo;t come forward. There seems to be an unfortunate stigma that goes hand-in-hand with rape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to drunk sex, we need to teach people that if you want to have sex, that&rsquo;s great, but it&rsquo;s okay to wait. If you wake up in the morning and both of you are still consenting, and you&rsquo;re both sober, then by all means, have at it! But if the feelings aren&rsquo;t still there, then maybe this isn&rsquo;t a good time. This is definitely not a popular message, but it&rsquo;s a message that needs to be shared. If you ultimately choose to throw caution to the wind and engage in sexual activity when there is not a solid yes, just know there could be some repercussions, consequences and issues that come along with your actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also a need for open discussions when it comes to our expectations in relation to sex. Some people like to have sex in certain ways and other people don&#39;t. Some people like to experiment sexually, others may not want to participate in experimenting. If you don&#39;t make those expectations clear, you could find yourself in a situation that you weren&#39;t prepared for and ultimately, an experience that you&rsquo;re not enjoying. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of conversations with students pertaining to sex. Conversations like a student feeling horrible because they had sex when they didn&rsquo;t really want to and now they&rsquo;re having trouble even looking at the other person. Another student expressed that they really weren&rsquo;t ready to have sex, but did it anyway. And yet another example of relationships between students that started out as nice, kind and sweet. They met in the residence hall, started holding hands and hanging out. Then the relationship turned sexual and now the relationship has soured; leaving everything uncomfortable between them and those around them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure most of you know that sex can definitely complicate things; especially when it comes to relationships. Sex can also make relationships better. Some people need and want sex front and center in their relationships; that&#39;s how they feel connected to people. You have to realize though, when you have sex with someone, it can take the relationship to a whole new level. Some people don&#39;t view sex as just something physical; they feel that it&#39;s something more special and intimate. Others view sex as just that&hellip;.sex, no relationship. This is another reason why you should set those expectations upfront, before sex occurs. No need for broken hearts when a conversation beforehand could eliminate any hard feelings or difficult situations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know people have been having sex since the dawn of time, that&rsquo;s nothing new, but I think the sexual trends have changed quite drastically. Think about when the integration of dormitories and residence halls started. The halls, or at least the floors in the hall, used to be gender specific. Now, with integration, they live in the same residence hall, not usually in the same rooms, but definitely in the same hall. They can go up a floor or down a floor or even across the hallway and see each other. They&rsquo;re seeing each other constantly and they&rsquo;re observing each other in their natural element. I know some of you parents are probably getting anxious right now. You&rsquo;re thinking, &ldquo;Oh God, my son is going to be living in the same residence hall with women!&rdquo; or &ldquo;My daughter is going to be in a residence hall with guys, what was I thinking?&rdquo; According to data that is available to student affairs professionals, highlighting sex and safety on college campuses, the issues occurring with mixed-gender dorms is minimal.&nbsp; We haven&rsquo;t encountered many problems, most likely due to sexual education, event programming, security as well as the ever-present RA&rsquo;s; these measures are there to keep everyone safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversations and open dialogue are a must when it comes to sex, especially when mixed genders are living in close proximity to each other. It all depends on what kind of hall you live in. I&rsquo;ve lived in a traditional hall where there was only one bathroom on the floor. Living in that hall, there were a few times when I happened to see women walking down the hallway in just a towel. This was a new experience for me and very eye-opening, as I&rsquo;m sure you can imagine. I&rsquo;ve also lived in halls where I had my own bathroom, in my room, and didn&rsquo;t have to encounter anyone in a towel. Either of these scenarios will be different to the student experiencing them. This may be your first exposure to an in-your-face view of the opposite sex. Sometimes these situations can be arousing. Sometimes it&#39;s exciting, simply because you haven&rsquo;t been around many different types of people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my position, as a student, as an RA and now as a student affairs professional, I&rsquo;ve been involved in many confidential conversations, with students, regarding pregnancy scares. Let me tell you, it doesn&rsquo;t just scare them; it scares me too! This is one reason why sexual education and sexual safety are so important. I can recall a particular situation with a student I knew. She was very active and involved on campus. She kind of had everything going for her; then she got pregnant. The sad part was she got pregnant by someone who didn&rsquo;t even care about her; it was just sex for him. This situation reflects back to what I&rsquo;ve said a few times, a conversation regarding expectations could have changed the outcome of her situation. The student ended up having to drop out of school and she never finished. She was an incredibly bright student and if I saw her today, I would still encourage her to go back and finish. I was so sad to see her go. I was sad that she had to put her dreams on hold all because of one misguided choice. I&rsquo;m sure it altered the young man&rsquo;s life as well, but I didn&rsquo;t have a relationship with him, so I wasn&rsquo;t privy to that information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not to say that everybody who gets pregnant in college doesn&rsquo;t have a chance to continue their education or that their life is ruined. No, absolutely not! Babies are definitely a blessing. Although, having a baby during college could definitely alter the goals you wish to accomplish. Understand that one decision, good or bad, can have a lasting impact on the rest of your life; depending on what type of decision you make. This is why I continue to emphasize the importance of making good decisions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sexual safety is also important when it relates to contracting sexually transmitted diseases and ultimately, spreading them. I would love to tell you that no one in college contracts STD&rsquo;s, but we all know that&rsquo;s not true. Ask any wellness professional, not only in a hospital or ER or clinic, but especially the ones on campus and they would tell you STD&rsquo;s are fairly common. I can recall a story where a student confided in me that he had an STD. When I asked him how he contracted an STD, he said he wasn&rsquo;t sure. When I questioned him further and asked him if he was having unprotected sex, he told me he was. I then asked him how many sexual partners he had; he told me three. I told him that it was his responsibility to figure out how to handle this situation. I did give him the following tips: First, go to the health center to make sure he definitely had an STD (he later found out that he did). Second, he would need to have an open and honest conversation with the three women he had sex with. And finally, he needed to start using condoms to prevent this type of situation from happening in the future. I know this conversation and the tips I gave the student sound a bit uncomfortable and definitely logical, but let me tell you, this is a normal day in the life of most student affair professionals. We&rsquo;re having grown, adult conversations with students who are making grown, adult decisions that don&rsquo;t always end well. We guide them as best as possible, in each situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember there was a girl who lived on campus who had a reputation for having sex with a lot of different guys. I want to pause and make a note here: This is not a female-only issue. Plenty of guys, in college, also have this reputation. Even though this student went on to do many great things at this university, the bad reputation that started in her first year on campus and continued into her second year, and beyond. That initial impression can often stay with you throughout your years on campus. Sure, you can absolutely feel bad for somebody with this type of reputation or stigma, especially so early on in there campus life. But, at the same time, there has to be some sort of personal responsibility and accountability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes these reputations have merit and sometimes they don&rsquo;t. I know a lot of you are probably thinking, &ldquo;Justin, of course you&rsquo;re telling a story where the girl was sleeping around and being promiscuous!&rdquo; No, I&rsquo;m going to give you the flip side too because I think that sometimes women get a bad rap when it comes to sleeping around and guys don&rsquo;t necessarily get the same treatment. A lot of times, women who sleep around are considered easy or loose or slutty, but guys are revered for that same behavior. On college campuses, there are both promiscuous, sexually active men AND there are also promiscuous, sexually active women. It&rsquo;s not one-sided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we talk to students who engage in sexual activity with multiple partners, I hear a multitude of different stories and most don&rsquo;t end well. There may be the female who&rsquo;s having sex with everyone on her floor or the guy that&rsquo;s trying to have sex with every single woman in his building. These scenarios can&rsquo;t end well. Again, your reputation is at stake and may follow you throughout your college experience. Is a moment of sexual gratification worth the risk?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my students once told me, &ldquo;A key that opens many locks, is a great key; but a lock that opens with many keys, is a bad lock.&rdquo; This isn&rsquo;t necessarily true and this statement definitely favors male promiscuity. Any type of sexual promiscuity comes with a reputation and consequences, whether you&rsquo;re male or female. A reminder to students, throughout your college experience, you are constantly networking, you&#39;re always interviewing, and you&rsquo;re continuously being looked at and judged by others. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you don&rsquo;t want to be judged. People are going to see what you show them of yourself and actions speak louder than words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My advice: I would say, don&#39;t be that person. When I have relationships with people, regardless if they were sexual in nature or just friendly, I just keep my business to myself. I&rsquo;m a very private person. You don&rsquo;t want everybody in your business, especially when it comes to college life because if you allow it, everybody will be all up in your business. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you live on a small campus or a big campus; interesting gossip spreads like wildfire and sex still sells. This is the same reason why I would discourage you putting your business on any social media platform. We&rsquo;ve seen situations when a student seeks revenge on social media, after a sexual encounter didn&rsquo;t end well. They&rsquo;re putting up pictures, sending Snapchats and sometimes sexting to get someone jealous. Don&rsquo;t do that! Don&rsquo;t be that person! Remember, what goes on the internet, stays on the internet&hellip;.FOREVER! Put your best foot forward, your best effort out there and don&rsquo;t get caught up in that kind of nonsense. If you&rsquo;re grown enough to engage in a sexual experience, you should be grown enough to handle any repercussions that may occur.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s time for a few stories that I recall from my time on campus. One story in particular stands out, where the front desk security guard saw a male and a female walking into a residence hall. Part of his responsibilities was to make sure all guests were signed in before they entered the hall. The guard asked the male student, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name? You need to sign her name in the login book.&rdquo; The male looked the female right in the face and said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name again?&rdquo; I think that&rsquo;s a problem, don&rsquo;t you? Let&rsquo;s not encourage that type of behavior. This is a prime example of why such rules are in place. It becomes a safety issue, for all parties involved. For real, if you&#39;re going to have sex with someone, at least have the decency to know their name. At the very least, know their name! I know this probably isn&rsquo;t a message we hear often and it may be an unpopular message, but it&rsquo;s a necessary message. You may hear something more along the lines of &ldquo;You&rsquo;re attracted to each other, have sex. This is America, you can do whatever you want to do.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m here to say that it is perfectly okay to take a step back and maybe get to know the person <em>before</em> you dive under the sheets. See what they&rsquo;re about and show them what you&rsquo;re about. Sex not only says something about them, but it says something about you, too. Again, let&rsquo;s look at both sides of the coin because it would be misleading and inaccurate for me to say that everybody who comes to college is out having wild and crazy sex and no one is being responsible or accountable. That&rsquo;s not true. My personal story tells you that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve also known individuals who came to college, or colleagues of mine, who had a lot of repressed sexual feelings. They came from strict, religious homes where they weren&rsquo;t allowed to even talk about sex, let alone have sex. Then, they come to college and it&rsquo;s like a free-for-all! No one there to tell them what to do and what not to do. Someone of the opposite sex starts giving them a little bit of attention, they like the way it feels and then they don&rsquo;t know what to do with those feelings. I would suggest talking these feelings through with someone. These thoughts or feelings aren&rsquo;t something you should keep to yourself because repressed sexual urges and sexual confusion can sometimes hinder you from making good and positive decisions. As humans, sometimes we make decisions based solely on how we feel. Of course we want to make logical decisions, but sometimes, in the midst of a situation, all logic is thrown out the window and feelings rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are unsure about something or if you have questions that are sexual in nature, ask someone! There is nothing wrong with asking questions about your body, sex or anything else you&rsquo;re unsure of. Asking questions is important and you shouldn&rsquo;t feel funny about it. Don&rsquo;t wait and sit on those questions, especially if you&#39;re confused about something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you need help, there are resources available to you. There is most likely, a local wellness center or clinic on or near campus, Planned Parenthood or a local community center. They have the resources, tools, kits, skills and staff designed to help students navigate this confusing and complicated and sometimes frustrating sexual world. I would highly suggest going and getting counseling at any one of those establishments, should you have questions regarding sex or your body. Issues dealing with sex should not be issues that you keep to yourself. You may end up in a situation where you&rsquo;re embarrassed or where things might not turn out the way you wanted. The situation could have been different if you had gathered some information or had a conversation with a professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another scenario that comes up in college is sexual experimentation with the same gender. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with this. If someone is going to experiment, it&rsquo;s probably going to happen in college. All the topics discussed in this chapter apply, regardless of who you&rsquo;re having sex with. The gender of your partner is irrelevant in this conversation. Make good choices and have consent!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tips for students:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t let one night of pleasure become a lifetime of regrets. What does that mean? I know a lot of people who had babies while they were in college and they didn&#39;t get to finish their education. For them, that one decision, that one night of pleasure had life-altering consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consent! Consent! Consent! Consent is so important and we don&rsquo;t talk about it enough. NO MEANS NO! Only a sober yes means yes! &ldquo;No means no&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;no unless you keep bugging me about it until I finally give in due to the pressure and say yes!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sexual education programs are available on most college campuses and are usually provided by the counseling center or the wellness center. I would encourage all students to go to those classes. They may teach you some things that you would never have known. They teach things like how to properly put a condom on, where to go if you contract an STD, where to get medication or birth control, and how to set up an appointment if you think that you&#39;re pregnant. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not required that you have sex! Just because you&rsquo;re in college, doesn&#39;t mean you have to have sex! Just because it may seem like everyone else is doing it, doesn&#39;t mean you have to do it. Look, I&rsquo;ll keep it &ldquo;100&rdquo; with you, it was <em>extremely </em>difficult to be celibate in college, but in the end, it was the best choice for me.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parents: What should you do in this situation? How do you guide your son or daughter to make the best decisions? Remember, you&rsquo;re not going to be there with them the entire time so you won&rsquo;t know what your child is doing 24/7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have open and honest dialogue about sex. Discuss questions like: What does it mean to be a sexually active young adult? What does having sex in college mean? Should you do it? Should you not do it? What about birth control options? All of these questions are important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your child does decide to have sex, don&rsquo;t beat them up about their decision. That&rsquo;s not a good tactic for future open dialogue. If you are lucky enough that your son or daughter opens up and talks to you about sex, please be open-minded and lend them your ear.</p>', '2020-09-07 23:16:17', '2020-09-11 00:01:44', NULL);

(26, 6, 'I’ll Take Safety For 300 Alex', NULL, 20, '<p>It should be of no surprise to anyone reading this book that safety is a major issue and concern on college campuses. There&#39;s theft, there&rsquo;s assault, there could be murder, there&#39;s definitely rape and sexual assault and there are also petty crimes. All of these things can happen on a college campus. I always want to keep my information factual, upfront and honest. This is never intended to scare you or to make you worry. What I hope it does is properly prepare you for what you &ldquo;may&rdquo; encounter. What is surprising is that there are a lot of parents, and students alike, who don&#39;t know these incidents are occurring on campuses; as if college campuses are exempt from these societal behaviors. Let&rsquo;s be honest, there is no place that is absolutely, 100% safe!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have to laugh when I see college marketing materials that flaunt these impressive statistics like &ldquo;The Ten Safest Schools in the U.S&rdquo;. I think, &ldquo;Sure, they may be safer, but they&#39;re not completely safe.&rdquo; These rankings are determined by statistics and studies regarding the safest campuses - data saying this one has the most police presence, or marketing materials showing students feel most welcome in the community. That&#39;s great, but is the data 100 accurate? Are they taking into account every single crime? The answer to that is no! The answer is no because not all crimes on campuses are reported. In fact, I would even argue that most crimes on campuses aren&rsquo;t reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do they create these top ten lists? Where does the data come from? What source is the data being collected from? Most institutions pay to have an independent auditor come in and verify that campuses are actually safe. They take a look at the public safety logs and how many students report issues to campus police. They look at whether or not the university is meeting the Clery standards determined in The Clery Act. The Clery Act is a federal statute requiring colleges and universities participating in federal financial aid programs to maintain and disclose campus crime statistics and security information. Then they take all these numbers and they come up with a list of the top ten safest schools for that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>College campuses can be a dangerous place, especially for individuals who don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing or people who aren&rsquo;t paying attention to their surroundings. You could be the victim of anything on a college campus. While there are resources such as: security, administrators, students and staff, remember that college exists in the real world; it&#39;s not exempt from crime solely because it&rsquo;s a college campus. There are a lot of students who go to schools that are located right in a city and I often hear them say, &ldquo;Well, it&#39;s a whole other part of the city; it has like a life of its own, separate from the city.&rdquo; No, it&rsquo;s not separate! It&#39;s in the middle of the city, therefore, it&#39;s a part of the city and crime happens there!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be aware of what&#39;s going on around you. I had to be self-aware of a lot of different things when I was on campus or off campus. When I was an undergrad, when I would walk at night, I would make sure that I walked in well-lit areas. I would think that some of the women that were on my campus did the exact same thing. I didn&rsquo;t leave my cell phone in the cafeteria on the table to save my spot because someone could easily come through and steal it. I&rsquo;m sure, as the reader, you&rsquo;re not a thief; you wouldn&rsquo;t steal from others. But you don&#39;t know how others were raised or what people are capable of. I see petty theft like this all the time. Students leaving their backpacks, with all their books and their laptop, so they can save a spot in the cafeteria or to save their favorite spot in the union hall. Then, two seconds later, someone snatches up their items and walks away like nothing ever happened. Be aware off your surroundings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be times when you find yourself in a situation that you don&rsquo;t know how to handle or a situation where you don&rsquo;t feel safe. An example of this is one night when I went to a baseball house party at an institution. I remember going into the party, with my friends, the majority of whom were of African-American descent. We had been invited by some young ladies, so we thought that was really cool. When we walked into the party, all the guys in the place just glared at us. Why? Because they didn&rsquo;t feel that we belonged! In fact, they came forward and told us that we didn&rsquo;t belong there. I remember one of the guys came up and said to me, &ldquo;What are you doing here, boy?&rdquo; I just gave him this crazy look like, <em>boy</em>? I had all my friends with me on this particular night so I was probably a little bit more testosterone-filled and big-boy pants filled that night than I normally would be. I said, &ldquo;What do you mean, <em>boy</em>?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;You heard me, boy!&rdquo; As soon as he said that, four of his friends got up, glaring at me and started moving towards me. At this point, my friends were mingling throughout the party. One of the other guys came up to me and said, &ldquo;You don&#39;t belong here. I suggest you find somewhere else to go.&rdquo; I immediately found my friends and said, &ldquo;Yo. Look, it&#39;s time for us to go. We gotta get out of here.&rdquo; My friends said, &ldquo;No! We just got here. We&rsquo;re having such a great time! It&rsquo;s fine, Justin, chill out!&rdquo; They didn&rsquo;t know what had just transpired. Now our safety was in jeopardy because my friends weren&rsquo;t <em>hearing </em>what I was saying. I remember grabbing one of my friend&rsquo;s arms as tight as I could and I said, &ldquo;Yo! Listen! We gotta roll&hellip;now! Let&rsquo;s all leave!&rdquo; My friends all just gave me the craziest look like, &ldquo;Oookkaayyy, I guess we&rsquo;re leaving?!&rdquo; When we got outside, I explained the situation to them. I said, &ldquo;Look, we were in danger in there.&rdquo; They asked me what I meant. I explained what had happened and then they understood. They said, &ldquo;Oh my gosh, Justin! Why didn&rsquo;t you come and get us and tell us?&rdquo; I explained to them, &ldquo;At that time, all I could think about was - GET OUT OF THIS SITUATION!&rdquo; We didn&rsquo;t know what we were walking into, but think about it, most students don&rsquo;t know when they&#39;re walking into a situation like that. This is why it&#39;s essential that you make sure to pay attention to your surroundings and that you know the people around you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a man on campus is much different than being a woman. There&rsquo;s kind of an unfair advantage being a male because there are a lot of safety issues that men don&rsquo;t have to worry about. I can only imagine how it feels to be a woman on a college campus. Not only do you have to fear walking around by yourself, you have to fear getting cat-called, you have to fear someone trying to sexually assault you, or someone trying to steal from you or grab you. Granted, the data shows us that most sexual assaults occur by someone that the victim knows, not necessarily some creeper that&rsquo;s hiding in a dark alley lying in wait for their next rape victim. That scenario is a folk-tale. Yes, I&#39;m sure those types of situations happen, but that&#39;s not the norm. Chances are, young college women are more likely to encounter a rape or assault situation by someone they know, someone they may be close to, such as a family member or friend. Of course sexual assaults can also just happen randomly. As a woman, how do you ensure your safety when you&#39;re walking around campus? You don&#39;t know everyone who&#39;s hanging around on campus. Do you go with friends? Do you make sure you have your cell phone on you? There&#39;s a lot of different variables to consider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember some of my female friends on campus downloaded this app on their phones. It was like a walk-along-buddy app. The basic gist of the app was, if they had to walk home from the bar and they didn&#39;t want to be by themselves, the phone could connect and you could track your friend as they were walking home to make sure they got home safely. What kind of society do we live in where women have to fear walking around alone? It&#39;s unfair because, as a male, and understanding my male privilege, I didn&#39;t have that same fear. In fact, most people were scared of me when I was walking around at night. I remember walking down the sidewalk and other people walking would jump off the sidewalk before we passed each other or they would cross to the other side of the street. I felt it was because I was a male of color, but that&rsquo;s just my opinion. It&rsquo;s unfair, but it&#39;s a different kind of unfair; I wasn&rsquo;t in danger. When I go out by myself, I don&rsquo;t fear for my life. In some ways I do, as a black male, but as a male, I never have to. Women definitely have that fear and it&rsquo;s unfair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to the topic of theft. Theft is a fairly common occurrence on campus. Make sure you know where your possessions are at all times! Try to make sure that you&rsquo;re not leaving your items, unsecured, in public. Be certain, that if you do have valuables, that they are locked up somewhere safe! I know a lot of students are new to this whole safety subject. In the comfort of their own home, where most of the time their parents were ensuring their safety and paying attention <em>for </em>them, they didn&rsquo;t have to worry about it. I can recall a story at an institution when we had our first year meeting, which almost every residence hall across the country takes part in. It&rsquo;s the first time where all the residents are in the building and all the RA&rsquo;s (Resident Assistants) are present for a first floor meeting. They talk about all the rules and regulations and all the fun things they&#39;re going to do, the hours of the hall, signing out equipment, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this particular meeting, Public Safety partnered with our residence life department. They went through each floor and every hallway while the residents were in the meetings downstairs in the lobby. They checked the locks on every door. If they found an unlocked door, they put a sign on it saying, you&rsquo;ve been robbed, please call Public Safety. When the meetings ended, the students went upstairs and of course, went right to their rooms and saw the little hanger on their door saying you&rsquo;ve been robbed. The students were immediately in a panic! &ldquo;Oh my gosh, I got robbed! What do I do? I got that on my door too! Oh my gosh, me too!&rdquo; At that moment, Public Safety would come down the hallway and say, &ldquo;Oh my gosh, what happened?&rdquo; The students explained what they found on their doors. Someone from Public Safety would smile and say, &ldquo;No, you haven&rsquo;t been robbed, but think about how you feel right now? This is exactly how you would feel if you <em>did</em> make the simple mistake of leaving your door unlocked again.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you move onto a college campus, everybody seems nice, everybody seems friendly and it doesn&rsquo;t appear like anyone would be out to get you or your belongings. You may have been raised to not take things that don&rsquo;t belong to you, but not everybody was raised like that. Always make sure your belongings are safe, guarded and locked up! So, at the end of that story, Public Safety went on to have a small safety program talk with the residents who left their doors open. Theft can happen so quickly, like in this scenario. By the time everybody got done with the first floor meeting, your entire room could have been cleaned out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only can theft happen, in a dorm, by a fellow resident, but residents and other students on campus have been known to steal books. Why steal books? Books are extremely expensive!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve seen a trend occurring with textbook thefts. Books are being stolen for usually, one of two reasons: For a student to use in their own class, therefore, not having to purchase it themselves and at the end of the semester so the thief can sell them back for money. There are many different outlets where you can sell textbooks back online, or of course, at the campus bookstore. A lot of students rent books so they can get some money back when they return the books. There are also third party companies that just buy books back. If there&rsquo;s a random book &ldquo;sitting there&rdquo;, the company still gives cash for it. There&rsquo;s really no method to trace who the book belongs to. Some students think, &ldquo;Why not? Why not just turn in this book and make a few extra bucks?&rdquo; Then as the victim in this situation, do you even know your book was stolen or does it hit you the next time you need it?&nbsp; Are you going to have to eat the cost because you weren&#39;t paying attention?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another popular item that is stolen on campuses are bikes. Listen, if you want to get your workout on, that&#39;s great. Use your campus recreation center or campus gym. Some students, depending on how large your campus is, like to bike around campus. Biking is really relaxing, physically beneficial and can help you get to and from classes or events on campus. I myself love to bike and own two bikes. There are some students that think they can leave their bike leaning up against the building and it will be there when they come back out of class. Nope! Don&rsquo;t do it! People steal bikes! Come on people, lock that bike up!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This should go without saying, but lock up that laptop! I see people all the time leaving their laptops in their local coffee shop or in their student union. They may ask someone, &ldquo;Can you watch this while I go to the bathroom?&rdquo; Of course, the other person says yes. Don&rsquo;t do it! You can&rsquo;t just trust individuals that you don&rsquo;t know. Don&rsquo;t leave your items unattended like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned previously, another common and very unfortunate incident that takes place on campuses is sexual assault and rape. Sexual assault and rape are defined separately. Sexual assault can be any unwanted sexual attention or sexual touch, without consent. Rape is defined as an event in which there is sexual penetration, without consent. Notice that both instances are equivalent regarding lack of consent. People don&#39;t like talking about these two topics because sexual assault and rape are such ugly and heinous acts. Think about it, would you like to talk about an extremely uncomfortable and painful event that took place? Be your brother&rsquo;s keeper! Pay attention to your surroundings and to the surroundings of those you love and care for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a second, right now, and think about the one person in this world who you care about the most; the person who you would do anything for, at any time, the person you couldn&rsquo;t live without. Maybe open up your phone, right now, and pull up a picture of them. Picture this person being harmed in the worst possible way. How does this make you feel? It sucks, doesn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s sad and it&rsquo;s depressing. It hurts and it&rsquo;s uncomfortable and heartbreaking. The thought of not being able to help this person, in that situation, is maddening. Now I want you to think about that same person, who you can&rsquo;t live without, in the same horrible situation. This time, think about what if someone had been there and could&rsquo;ve helped change the outcome of the situation, but chose not to. How does this make you feel? You&rsquo;re may be feeling angry, outraged, filled with sadness, because someone chose not to intervene on behalf of the person that you love. What if your loved one was in that horrible situation, but instead someone chose to intervene and help them? How does that make you feel? You probably feel a little bit better; you may even have a sense of relief. You may feel some gratitude and feel thankful that someone selflessly responded on that person&rsquo;s behalf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sexual assault and rape happen every day on college campuses. These abominable crimes should remind each one of us to pay attention and be aware, not just for ourselves, but for others as well. We should be active in these situations. It&rsquo;s called being a bystander. Being a bystander, as a college student, is paramount. Why? You can&#39;t just stand on the sidelines and watch and allow these and other situations to happen. I&#39;m not just talking about sexual assault and rape. I&rsquo;m also talking about threats and stalking. I&rsquo;m talking about the use of inappropriate language or derogatory language. I&#39;m talking about theft. I&#39;m talking about any incident that prevents or could potentially prevent your campus community from flowing forward in a positive manner where the residents are safely cohabitating in harmony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve all seen things that were wrong and we didn&rsquo;t speak up. Is it because we&rsquo;re scared? Is it because we don&#39;t want to get involved? I know we live in the &ldquo;no snitching era&rdquo; but those concepts have to change. We have to inform people and let someone know if wrongdoings are taking place. Sometimes, we may have to be invasive and take action on our own. I know some people have no problem speaking up for someone and going directly to the individual to impede a particular behavior, but not everyone is like that. If you&rsquo;re not like that and you don&rsquo;t want to get involved, or maybe you don&rsquo;t want to bring attention to yourself, then tell someone who <em>will </em>get involved! Let someone on campus know that the situation is taking place. Tell someone in Public Safety, a college administrator, a coach, someone local in the community. Someone has to know; someone needs to know. That&rsquo;s what being a bystander is all about. Making sure that you are aware of what&#39;s taking place and doing something about it. There are bystander training opportunities that are happening all around the country. One training is called &ldquo;Green Dot&rdquo;, another is called the &ldquo;It&rsquo;s On Us Campaign&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Rape and Sexual Awareness Group&rdquo;. All of these are taking place on campuses all across the country. Are these programs truly making a difference? I would like to think they are, but why don&rsquo;t you involve yourself and then let me know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I went through a training for sexual assault awareness and I thought it was phenomenal. I didn&#39;t know too much about sexual assault and rape until I was immersed in the actual training. I personally think my lack of knowledge was due to my gender. I don&rsquo;t feel like the male gender is necessarily educated on these topics. I think the education is unequal. Think about what women are taught regarding sexual assault; they&rsquo;re at least taught all of the don&rsquo;ts; Don&rsquo;t go out alone, don&rsquo;t wear this, don&rsquo;t be flirty, don&rsquo;t wear this perfume, don&#39;t be sexually promiscuous, don&#39;t act like you&#39;re coming on to someone. They may as well be taught to wear a burlap bag when they go out so they won&rsquo;t look appealing to men. And men are taught, no means no. Then of course, they sometimes even get a pass on that in the form of &ldquo;boys will be boys&rdquo;. Alcohol doesn&#39;t cause rape; people cause rape. When there are people who are not properly educated, who are allowed to walk around and do whatever they want to do, with no repercussions that can incite the perfect opportunity for rape or sexual assault. We live in a &ldquo;rape culture&rdquo; that says, &ldquo;We don&#39;t want this one person to feel bad about this one crime that they committed! Men will be men, boys will be boys. It happened, its college! She was asking for it with that short skirt she had on.&rdquo; That type of behavior and thinking are unacceptable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a campus security authority on my campus, I&#39;ve talked to individuals who have experienced sexual assault or rape. I can&rsquo;t imagine the emotional, physical, and psychological feelings and pain that are associated with a traumatic event like rape. Rape culture suggests that it&#39;s okay, it&rsquo;s a one-time thing or maybe she wanted it or they were both drunk so that makes it okay or kids will be kids, they&rsquo;ll make mistakes. NO! Rape culture is a sociological concept used to describe a setting in which rape is pervasive and normalized due to societal attitudes about gender and sexuality. There should never be an instance where we give a pass to sexual assault or rape. We have to redefine and change that culture and thought process. I&#39;m sorry but we have to call men to the carpet because the majority of rapes that take place on our college campuses are acted out by men; although there are instances of male rape. A person who performs such a heinous act, like sexual assault or rape should be held accountable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also instances of sexual assault and rape happening in the LGBTQIA community. Those individuals are also suffering from this trauma and the assault or rape may come with added physical injury as well, especially if the act is part of a hate crime. Many times sexual assault is not reported in the LGBTQIA community at all; either because the person not only has to talk about the assault, but may have to reveal their sexual identity. Some of these individuals may not have come out yet or don&rsquo;t publicly identify with the community. It&rsquo;s almost like a catch-22.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sexual assault and rape aren&rsquo;t necessarily about the actual act of sex. For some offenders it could be about power, control or dominance over another human being. Think about it, there are plenty of ways to have sex, be aroused and ultimately climax or achieve release, but none of that constitutes sexual assault or rape. Trust me, if you&rsquo;re on a college campus and someone says no to having sex with you, there are more than enough other people who probably will say yes. Sexual assault or rape should never, ever be an option. Again, if there&rsquo;s not a sober yes being said, than there&rsquo;s no consent, therefore it&#39;s rape! Sleep it off and revisit the situation when you&rsquo;re both sober.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know I&rsquo;ve brought up a lot of topics in this chapter that are uncomfortable and a little alarming. You are, no doubt, a little freaked out right now. You&rsquo;re probably wondering how could these things be happening on college campuses? One of the most important notions we can take away from this is to NEVER blame the victims. The victims of sexual assault, victims of theft, and victims of any type of physical assault are not at fault. It&rsquo;s not their fault if an offender makes a poor choice. These people are the victims and survivors of these situations. We should make a very serious effort to equip ourselves and those around us with the best information possible. This will help us be more compassionate and hopefully, help us make more informed choices. It&#39;s not up to the school to make sure that everyone is safe. The school can&rsquo;t be completely protected. Sometimes when I see these situations happen, people are quick to blame the university. Yes, in some cases, the universities are definitely at fault when it pertains to the overall safety of the students on campus, but other times they aren&rsquo;t at fault. We&#39;ve got to give our students the best knowledge and information possible so they can make safe and wise decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s talk about some resources that are commonly available on college campuses, across the country that students can use to enhance their safety. Almost all campuses have call boxes. These boxes are there to ensure that a student or bystander can call the university police immediately if they see something bad happening. Of course, if you have your cell phone, you can always dial 911. If you witness a theft, someone being &ldquo;cat-called,&rdquo; or a physical altercation, you should be able to utilize one of these call boxes. Your university police should respond in a timely manner. On a few campuses that I&rsquo;ve worked on, they had an emergency alert system. This could be accessed on your desktop, phone, the website, or through the T.V. monitoring systems located throughout the campus. Emergency alert systems were enabled so that students and staff would automatically know if there was a campus emergency. For example, consider the events that occurred on the Virginia Tech campus in 2007. While there was a mass shooting on campus, many individuals weren&rsquo;t aware that a violent, emergency situation was transpiring. How can we make ourselves more aware of these situations, especially when we need to get to safety?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These safety measures are not only helpful when it comes to assault, theft, burglary or physical assault, they&rsquo;re also very helpful what it comes to inclement weather. Depending on where you are located, some campuses experience snow storms, hurricanes, tornadoes or even earthquakes. How will you know if the campus is closed or if there&rsquo;s a delay to the campus opening? If your campus has an emergency broadcasting system or emergency alert system, I would highly encourage you to sign up for the alerts to ensure that you get the notifications. It&rsquo;ll take you two seconds to sign up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should have Public Safety or campus security&rsquo;s phone number added as a contact in your phone. You never know when an emergency is going to happen and you want make sure that you can call public safety immediately. At the end of the day, situations happen and time is of the essence. We don&#39;t have the ability to say, &ldquo;Oh well, I&rsquo;ll just give it a few minutes to see if someone shows up.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call as soon as I can.&rdquo; Make sure you have them on speed dial. When it comes to the favorites on my phone, Public Safety is definitely on my favorites list. And not just because I&#39;m a campus authority but because I want to make sure that if I do see something, I can help by getting in touch with Public Safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to talk about Public Safety because Public Safety has a different significance on each college campus. On some campuses, Public Safety has a really good relationship with the students and you&rsquo;ll see Public Safety, physically, around campus. They&#39;re on bikes, on foot, doing rounds in the buildings or in their patrol cars. They have a very friendly relationship with the students. On some campuses, that&rsquo;s not the case. On these campuses, students don&#39;t really like or trust Public Safety. They feel they&rsquo;re just gun-toting individuals who walk around and &ldquo;enforce&rdquo; the law. You also have to understand that some students are coming from a culture or environment where the police aren&rsquo;t trusted and they bring that same mentality to campus. Therefore, their perception of Public Safety or campus police is one of distrust. Regardless of how you feel about Public Safety, their job is to serve and protect. Most importantly, their job is to be visible and to keep you safe. Bottom line, if you see or hear something happening, that you know shouldn&rsquo;t be happening, alert someone. You have to say something and you have to do something. There should be no such thing as, &ldquo;Oh, I saw this happen but I didn&#39;t pay too much attention to it and didn&rsquo;t tell anyone.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m also not exempt from this. I remember one night when I saw an undergrad student walking out of the residence hall with three or four other guys. He was blindfolded and they threw him in the trunk and drove away. Me and my friend were like, &ldquo;What the heck?&rdquo; We were first year students and didn&rsquo;t know what was going on. We didn&rsquo;t know this was some crazy thing that shouldn&rsquo;t happen. We didn&#39;t say anything. Granted, it was probably part of some initiation process but at the same time we probably should have let someone know, but we chose not to. I didn&rsquo;t know enough then, but I know now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s why I&#39;m telling you these stories. Not because I want to seem like, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so high and mighty. Let me write this book because I never had any issues.&rdquo; No, I went through these situations. I have colleagues who went through these situations. I travel to colleges all across the country and hear the same stories, over and over. It&rsquo;s up to each one of us to do something. A couple of sentences ago, I said to you, if you see something, say something and do something. This is me telling you again. I wrote this book so you could have an instruction manual; that&rsquo;s me doing something. What are you going to do? What are you going to do to ensure that your campus is safe and you and your peers are making the best possible decisions when it comes to campus safety?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some other tips for students and parents to talk about when engaging in conversations about safety. I&rsquo;m sure some of this information is going to seem trivial, like I&#39;m preaching to the choir, but what may be common sense to you or me, may not be to someone else. It is important to remain safe by using common sense and if something doesn&rsquo;t feel right, it probably isn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Don&rsquo;t walk down dark alleys or streets alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Make sure you stay with your friends. Make sure that someone knows where you are, and to check in with individuals. Make sure that you know where you are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*If a certain house on campus or certain athletic group or Greek affiliation or any type of student activity group has a reputation that&#39;s not too kosher, maybe that&#39;s not where you should be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Pay attention to the signs. If you see individuals that are too drunk, get them help. If you see someone had their drink messed with, let them know. Speak up!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Don&#39;t go home with people you don&#39;t know. I know this sounds self-explanatory and sounds like common sense, but you&#39;d be surprised at the number of people who go home with a stranger at the end of a drunken night. That&rsquo;s completely unsafe for all parties involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*If you&rsquo;re drunk, don&#39;t drive. Just because you&#39;re on campus and you live off campus, don&#39;t think you can drive. Don&rsquo;t think to yourself, &ldquo;Oh I&#39;ve done this plenty of times, I can do it.&rdquo; I can&#39;t tell you the number of DUIs I&#39;ve seen or accidents that have happened due to the consumption of alcohol. Just don&#39;t do it! Don&#39;t risk it! Stay where you are! Here&rsquo;s the thing, when you&rsquo;re out driving while intoxicated, you not only have to worry about yourself but you have to worry about the individuals around you. Be responsible and be accountable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why don&#39;t we have conversations about safety? Do we just assume that people know how to be safe? If that&rsquo;s the assumption, then everyone <em>would</em> be safe, right? In this day and age, most individuals are not being mindful of safety. So, if people aren&rsquo;t being safe, where&rsquo;s the breakdown in the passing of information?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parents, are you teaching your children how to ensure that they&rsquo;re safe-guarding themselves, their belongings and those around them when they&#39;re no longer under your roof? Again, think about the fact that these students are coming to college campuses for the first time. They&rsquo;re only between 18-22 years old; they&rsquo;re young adults. Have you taught them how to protect themselves? Have you taught them what to do if they find themselves in a situation where their safety or other people&rsquo;s safety could be in jeopardy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students, I know sometimes you think you&#39;re a grown adult and that you can handle almost anything. Just because you can, doesn&#39;t mean that you should. This chapter is really important because I want individuals to make sure they&#39;re making the best decisions possible when it comes to their safety and the safety of those around them. Unfortunately, sometimes these decisions are regrettable and can&rsquo;t be reversed. Some situations are so bad that individuals completely ruin their entire college experience. Some individuals even have to drop out or transfer to different campuses. All because they&#39;ve made decisions, that if they had been in their right mind, or had more education, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t have made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This chapter wasn&rsquo;t written to make you fear campus life. No, this chapter was written to ensure that you&#39;re having a dialogue about safety. These are things that you should be talking about. You should really be talking about these things <em>before</em> you even get into college. This isn&rsquo;t to make you look at people sideways and question every single person and situation (Is this person out to harm me? Is this the person who&rsquo;s going to blindfold me and put me in the trunk like Justin was talking about? Is this the person that&rsquo;s going to lace my drink?) I don&rsquo;t think most people are bad. I think that there are individuals who are at college just to have fun, get their education and party a little bit. I would say, for the most part, the majority of students that go out and have fun, do actually get home safely, but it&#39;s not a guarantee. Nothing is guaranteed! Things are not this or that; they&rsquo;re not black or white. There is a gray area. That gray area is you being aware. The gray area is you paying attention to your surroundings. The gray area is making sure that you have the knowledge and information so that you can make the best decisions possible.</p>', '2020-09-07 23:19:13', '2020-09-11 00:01:39', NULL);

Well, you would think it would be difficult. I expect that throughout this chapter, with what I&#39;ve learned while in higher education, I will be able to give an unbiased view when it comes to spirituality and students. Give it a read and let me know what you think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raise your hand if you were born and raised with any type of religion. Okay, I&#39;m guessing that most of you raised your hands. So, how do you apply religion to your everyday life? Is it something that&rsquo;s important to you? Do you actively participate in worship? Is it something that guides your moral compass in life&rsquo;s decision making? Most people are introduced and taught some type of religious belief, starting in childhood. Do you think that practice has changed over the years? The real question I have is, did your spiritual beliefs change while you were in college? As you grow up, mature and develop, values you once believed in, methods that guided your decision and ideals which you knew to be true, can change based on life experiences that have taken place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, as a Christian, it was a no brainer. Jesus died on the cross for my sins. I no longer have to suffer the penalty of hell. I choose to believe in Him. Period! Generally, everyone that I grew up with, in my community, was also a Christian. It never even crossed my mind that I would ever be placed in a position where the majority of the people didn&#39;t feel the same way. I didn&rsquo;t want to go to a Christian school because I went to a Christian church my whole life. While I love church folk, this was my opportunity to branch out and discover new landscapes. I had no concept of the depth of what that truly meant. When I went to college (colleges!), I quickly discovered that the rest of the world doesn&rsquo;t necessarily feel the same way I do. Not everybody believes in Jesus; in fact, a lot of people don&#39;t believe in anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you go to school believing that everybody is going to be just like you and have the same beliefs as you, you&#39;ll be in a world of trouble. Like I said, a lot of people that I met in college didn&#39;t believe in anything. You would have loved to have seen my face the first time someone told me that they were an atheist; it was priceless! I had never talked to someone who didn&#39;t have any type of belief. I actually think the atheist student population is on the rise. Many students don&#39;t believe in any type of organized religion and can you blame them? The data and trends that we see across the country show that students see people who are in religious positions or people who take religious stances as very judgmental and mistreating of others. People, namely college students, don&#39;t like that type of behavior!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In today&rsquo;s day and age, I find students are more in the mode of advocacy or activism than they ever have been before. People saying things like, &ldquo;Oh, you&#39;re wrong. You&rsquo;re trying to force people to believe in what you believe in&rdquo;. That is totally against what most students want to experience now. Like I said, going to college was an interesting transition to begin with and then having to question my faith on a daily basis threw another monkey wrench into my day to day living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about my first college party. I can recall walking into someone&#39;s off campus apartment and everybody just welcoming me and my friends with open arms and shaking our hands. There was a lot of drinking going on, there was really loud music playing and there were multiple T.V.&#39;s blaring. There were women walking around, not wearing much clothing; leaving little to the imagination. Growing up as a Christian, this type of scenario, with these visuals wasn&rsquo;t anything I had ever experienced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember walking into one of the rooms where I saw a bunch of guys hunched over a box. Of course I went over to see what was in the box. What do you think I saw? Yup, a gigantic snake in the box! I was like, &ldquo;Whoaaaaa!&rdquo; The guy said, &ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s about to eat. Wait until you see this!&nbsp; We&#39;re taking bets.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Taking bets on what?&rdquo; Then, out of the corner of my eye, I see a guy go into a container and pull out two mice. The guy then took out a permanent marker and on one mouse&rsquo;s back he wrote the number one and on the other mouse&rsquo;s back, he wrote the number two. They held up the mice and everybody started cheering and chanting. I was sitting there wondering what the heck was going on and what the heck was about to happen. They then proceeded to put both mice into the snake box and of course, the snake took notice right away. The snake slowly started stalking towards the mice. Everyone was cheering and screaming. The snake slowly got closer to number two. He was slithering along the side; you could see the panic in the mouse&#39;s face. All a sudden the snake got up and BAM, attacked mouse number two. While he was eating mouse number two, one of the guys took mouse number one out of the box. I guess that would be the snake&rsquo;s meal for the next time he needed to eat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had never seen anything like this! So now I&rsquo;ve been to a party where people were drunk, where there were scantily clad women, where there was cursing, where there was betting or gambling, I&rsquo;m fairly certain some underage drinking and probably some drug use happening. Completely different world than I was accustomed to. As a Christian male, with a religious background, how could I learn to navigate this new terrain? How could I learn to morally and socially assimilate into this community that I wasn&rsquo;t raised in? I was basically a foreigner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a black male who went to a P.W.I.(which is a predominantly white institution), and having Christian values, I figured the best thing I could do was to immediately attempt to find a church where I could continue to plant my roots and grow in Christ. I grew up in an all-black church, but when I started looking around for a local church in my new western Pennsylvania college area, there weren&rsquo;t many black churches. I decided church is church so I would visit a white church; color doesn&rsquo;t matter. My first visit to an all-white church was interesting, to say the least. In my home church, people are loud and their expression of their love for God is lively and exuberant. Their love for God is shown through song, dance, clapping and verbal praise. When the pastor says something, you respond to the pastor verbally or with a nod of agreement. You may shout out a &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; Someone might yell out an &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; When I went to my first white church, everyone was kind of silent and when I yelled out &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;, everybody just kind of looked at me like I was crazy! I thought, &ldquo;Heeeyyy, I&rsquo;m just trying to serve and worship God!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole experience was intriguing. There was such a contrast in the way church people behaved and I couldn&rsquo;t understand it; we&rsquo;re all of the same faith. At that moment, I was trying to figure out what the faith meant to me in this new environment. Now that I wasn&rsquo;t beside Mom and Dad, what did the faith really mean to me? Was it something that was truly for me, that I absolutely believed in? Or was it something that I was just doing because that&#39;s what I was taught and that&rsquo;s what I knew?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried the Christian organization on campus; some people call them, &ldquo;Campus Crusade for Christ (or Cru)&rdquo; and it simply wasn&rsquo;t for me.&nbsp; I&#39;m a Christian and I love Christ just as much as the next person, but not every single Christian group is something you&rsquo;ll find interest in. I was learning this first hand. I felt like the people in &ldquo;Cru&rdquo; were way too happy for me; something wasn&rsquo;t right! Now look, I was happy that I was going to heaven, but I wasn&rsquo;t <em>that </em>happy! I really needed to figure this out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily for me God knew (as usual) exactly what I needed. He sent someone into my life at the exact time I needed it. I try to change people&#39;s names in my books and titles, but I figure, in this case, it was best to keep his real name. This guy&#39;s name is Michael Thornhill and he&rsquo;s a great guy! Michael Thornhill was a colleague of mine who transferred from a Christian college to a secular college. This is a very interesting story and if you ever get the chance to meet Michael, you should definitely ask him about his story. It couldn&rsquo;t have been a more opportune time for God to send him my way. At that time, I was really struggling with my faith. I was being tempted with so many new and different obstacles and challenges: women, drugs, alcohol, sex. I didn&#39;t really have anybody in my corner; someone who would hold me accountable and make sure I was still following God. I remember the day that Michael Thornhill arrived on campus. He came up to me and said, &ldquo;Hey. How you doing? I&rsquo;m Michael Thornhill.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Hey. I&rsquo;m Justin Brown.&rdquo; Michael said, &ldquo;Yeah, everyone told me to come talk to you. They said you&rsquo;re the guy who runs stuff around here. You&#39;re the guy that knows everything about the campus inside and out.&rdquo; I responded, &ldquo;Yeah. I guess you could say that.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve also been told that I&#39;m the Justin Brown of my former campus and that you&rsquo;re the person I&#39;m supposed to connect with.&rdquo; Since I had just met him, I didn&rsquo;t know much about him and didn&rsquo;t quite know how to take that statement. But I can tell you this, &ldquo;God definitely doesn&#39;t make mistakes, nor does HE <em>not</em> send individuals to you, on your behalf, from HIM.&rdquo; I knew that Michael was that person that God had sent me, right when I needed him. We talked about our faith. I remember thinking how serious Michael was about his faith, versus how I was with mine. Now, after getting to know him a little, I was confused. I asked myself, &ldquo;Was I just going through the motions or did I really want to serve God? Did I really want to follow the path that God wanted me to do?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was something Michael said to me that I will never forget and I doubt that he even remembers having this particular conversation, but if he does, he probably doesn&rsquo;t realize the significance and impact he had or how his words affected my life. One day, we went out to eat at this awesome place in the local town. If you ever get to Slippery Rock University, you have to eat at this delicious place called Bob&rsquo;s Subs. Michael was talking to me about faith. He asked me if I was going to church and I told him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried a few churches in the area but I haven&rsquo;t found a good fit. I tried singing and praise dancing in the churches, but the people kind of just looked at me like I was crazy! I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be trying any more churches out here in this area.&rdquo; Michael said, &ldquo;I would challenge you to give some other churches a chance or try to find the church that&#39;s the best fit for you, while you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; I looked at him like &ldquo;No, dude, I tried all the churches.&rdquo; Michael looked right in my face and said, &ldquo;How seriously do you want it? How seriously do you want to please God? How seriously do you want to exercise and participate in your faith?&rdquo; I remember Michael telling me, &ldquo;Look, in America, we have liberties that others around the world don&#39;t have. There are people being hunted down, exposed and killed in other countries for their beliefs and their faith. Yet, here in America, we have the freedom to believe what we want and we take that freedom for granted.&rdquo; When he said that to me, it really hit home and made me think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As college students, sometimes you have to think about forming your own morals and values, outside of mom and dad. At this point, I didn&rsquo;t have my mom and dad beside me through these new experiences and temptations. I was going through persecution and I was going through it alone. I needed to find my own way. I had to rely on everything that I was taught, everything that was instilled in me as a child so I could return back to it when I walked away. That was the day that kicked me in my butt and jump-started me right back into my faith. Not that I had ever lost my faith, but I wasn&#39;t actively practicing. I wasn&rsquo;t actively talking to God. Ever since then, I continued to walk forward in God&rsquo;s steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know some of you who are reading this chapter don&#39;t believe in God or you might not be a Christian and that is perfectly fine! This is okay because this is an opportune time to reflect on your own spiritual beliefs. How are you handling your new environment AND the beliefs you have? If you don&rsquo;t have any beliefs, what are your values? I&rsquo;m asking this because what I&rsquo;ve noticed is that there are so many students who don&rsquo;t believe in anything. This may be because of their upbringing or events that have taken place in their life or just the world in general. I&rsquo;m not saying you have to believe in God, but having a belief system or at the very least a set of values to draw from can certainly help you live your day to day life; especially in a new environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of people, regardless of whether you&rsquo;re a college student or not, have gone to religious organizations and have been judged, turned away, or had a church, synagogue or temple turn their back on them. This action goes against every single thing that the faith stands for. This could, absolutely, cause people to not want to believe or be a part of anything. Why would you want to believe in an organized religion that treats people the exact way they&rsquo;re telling people on the outside not to? If their claim is to treat their neighbor with kindness and they fail to do so, who would want to be a part of that? It seems hypocritical, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of you may not believe in God and that&rsquo;s understandable. There&#39;s a huge part of this chapter that&#39;s about you. My question to you is: if you don&#39;t believe in God, that&#39;s fine but what do you believe in? Do you believe in yourself?&nbsp; Do you believe in your own abilities? Do you believe in the cosmos of the universe to come up with decisions that are going to help you or guide your moral compass? Or do you just walk around lost? By lost, I don&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing or where you&rsquo;re going, but do you feel a sense of purpose? If you don&rsquo;t have a sense of purpose, where do you find it? What guides you? If you don&rsquo;t have any guiding principles, how do you move forward in life?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The people who are atheists or the people who don&#39;t believe in anything or don&#39;t have any faith, they&#39;re not bad people. They&rsquo;re not individuals who can be measured on a scale of good or bad. I do have some questions, though. Why have people gotten to this place of no faith? Atheists that I&rsquo;ve talked to, in my opinion, are atheists because they truly don&#39;t see any signs of God or they don&#39;t see how God works in and through people&#39;s lives. They need to see some hard, tangible evidence. They don&rsquo;t believe in the faith, because believing in faith alone is putting all your hopes and dreams into something that you can&rsquo;t see, touch or feel. As a human being and as a Christian, I get that; it makes sense, its logical! I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a big difference between Christians and atheists. As a Christian, sometimes I&rsquo;ve doubted my faith. I&rsquo;ve doubted whether God was with me or if God had played a significant part in my life. Or if I prayed and it didn&rsquo;t work out like I asked, I&rsquo;ve wondered if God was really listening, as if God is a genie who&rsquo;s supposed to listen to my commands when I ask. So I get it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people don&#39;t believe in religious organizations anymore because some individuals who represent religious organizations judge and persecute; they don&#39;t act any different than anybody who&#39;s on the outside. I personally know people like that in religious organizations. So yes, there are a lot of things that the atheists feel or believe that I also feel or believe, as a God-fearing Christian. That shows me that we&#39;re not all that different. We might be different in what we actually believe but we&rsquo;re not fundamentally different. How does all of this play out for college students? All of these individuals live together and are supposed to thrive together as a community. How can that work?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of what you believe, making a definitive decision is important. Are you going to make the decision to believe what you want to believe or are you going to believe in what you&rsquo;re taught to believe?&nbsp; For those who are going to college, who have religious backgrounds but now mom and dad can&#39;t force you to go to mass, church, synagogue, temple or wherever, you have to make a decision for yourself. How real is it going to be for you? I would highly recommend that you remember what you were taught. College is a huge playground for sin. It&rsquo;s a huge playground for experimenting. Things happen in college that you would probably never normally be exposed to. Remember what you were taught. Remember the values and morals that were instilled in you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, it&#39;s up to you to make the decision of what you believe in. No one can do that for you.&nbsp; Ultimately, you&#39;re going to be held accountable for the decisions that you made. Therefore, pay attention to the decisions and choices you&rsquo;re making and don&rsquo;t just think you&rsquo;re in college and you&rsquo;re grown so your faith doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore. That&rsquo;s not what college life is about. It&rsquo;s more about the things that you were taught growing up and everything up to this point: do you still want to continue to hold true to your values? Or do you want to change your values to what you want them to be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure most parents reading this chapter will be saying, &ldquo;No. My child is going to do this or my child is going to do that.&rdquo; You have to understand, during this time, your child is going to change; they will be different when they come back to your house. They&rsquo;re not going to be the same person. In fact, most kids have to be retaught by their parents and relearn some lessons because they&#39;re completely different when they return back to you. The person who you dropped off at college may not be the same person that comes home. Parents, be flexible. Be understanding. Have open and engaging conversations with your children. The conversations shouldn&rsquo;t be judgmental and they shouldn&rsquo;t be a smack-down. Your kids are trying to figure out who they are and where they belong in this crazy world. They need you during this transition. It won&rsquo;t help if you disparage your child when they make a choice you don&rsquo;t agree with. I&rsquo;m not saying let them do whatever they want; not at all. When I came home, I couldn&#39;t just tell my parents, &ldquo;Oh, hey, when I&rsquo;m at college I come home at 2am so I&rsquo;ll be home around 2am.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t work like that. There are still rules. In my parents&rsquo; house, as long as I lived under my father&#39;s roof, I was going to follow his rules. At the same time, we were able to have some open and honest conversations about what was going on and what I wanted to do. For example: &ldquo;Hey dad. I think I&rsquo;m going to go out to this party tonight. The party doesn&rsquo;t start until such and such time. I know the house rules are that I need to be home by such and such time, but would you mind if I did this tonight?&rdquo; Having an open dialogue with your child makes for a more harmonious living environment; not only for your children, but for you as well. I also want to note, not everyone comes from a family that allows this type of dialogue. Some households would never support the student negotiating a change in the rules like I mentioned. This is why parents need to understand that with the change and development your child is going through in college, some things may need to change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several things that I would highly recommend for students who want to continue practicing their faith while on campus. I would suggest getting involved in the religious organizations that are on campus. They meet regularly and are set up and designed to talk to college students about their college experience and how the experience affects their beliefs and their faith. They go on excursions and trips. They worship together. These organizations can be invaluable to the students on campus who crave what they may be missing from their home-based religious organization. If your faith is something you want to continue while on campus, know that there are options available. For people like me, who feel a bit odd at some of these religious organizations and may think, &ldquo;Hey, these people are weird, I don&rsquo;t want to be a part of this,&rdquo; sometimes you have to step out on faith. I remember finding some of the students of color, on campus, who kind of worshiped the same way I did, so we all went to church together. We started our own Bible study and <em>that </em>worked for me. Figure out what works best for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a student who does practice the beliefs of a particular faith or a student who does not, I would also suggest that you branch out and expose yourself to different cultures. During my time at school, while I wasn&#39;t changing my faith or changing my beliefs, I was very interested in how other religions and people of different faiths worshipped: how they collectively came together and how they worship their God. I&rsquo;ve gone to mosques. I&#39;ve gone to temples. I&rsquo;ve gone to a synagogue. I once went to a religious event, which was part of a faith I had no clue about, and I felt it was beneficial in helping me understand that particular faith. A good friend of mine invited me to a Seder dinner, which is a Jewish custom. The Seder is a feast that includes reading from the old testament, drinking wine, telling stories, eating special foods and singing; it&rsquo;s a tradition for people of the Jewish faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I participated in the entire Seder dinner: eating the bitters, partaking in eating the lamb and going through the entirety of the rituals. I thought it was great! My Jewish friend told me all about his background, explaining why they did this or why they did that. While the experience didn&rsquo;t change my views about what I believe in, it allowed me to learn about a different faith and their traditions. For some people, this experience I participated in might alarm you and may even cause you to ask, &ldquo;How could you ever step foot in a synagogue or go to a mosque or temple? You&rsquo;re a Christian!&rdquo; My advice to those people would be - learning doesn&#39;t take away from what you believe. If anything, learning helps you to be more appreciative of what you believe and also helps you be a globally-minded individual. If you came to campus so you could only hang out with people who look like you, go to classes with people who think like you and become friends with people who act like you, then you&rsquo;re wasting your time and, more importantly, you&rsquo;re wasting your money. A big part of college is learning about and understanding other individuals&rsquo; backgrounds, cultures and beliefs. I would suggest taking the time to get to know other people. Go to their houses, go to their religious organization, try some of the food from their culture and pay attention to the language. All of these elements help form you into a better, well-rounded person; they make you a more globally diverse student which benefits you and those around you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In life, good things happen and of course, bad things happen too. There are going to be people on your campuses who don&#39;t understand your faith. They won&#39;t understand why you believe what you believe and they are going to challenge you. I remember telling people on campus that I was a Christian and people tried to ask me questions that were almost impossible for me to answer. They would ask questions such as, &ldquo;Okay, well if Christ is <em>your </em>God, how come you haven&rsquo;t seen him?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What about the times when you prayed to God and he didn&#39;t answer your prayers?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How does Jesus say don&#39;t drink alcohol, yet he drank wine?&rdquo; It was as if they were trying to trip me up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Growing up as a P.K. (Preacher&rsquo;s kid) was challenging. It was difficult trying to maintain my faith and balance what the world offered. Attempting to be a role model to others was tough, while trying to answer everyone&#39;s suspicious questions. Here&rsquo;s the thing: no one knows <em>everything</em> about their religion. My dad is a pastor and sure, most of the time when I ask him a question, he knows the answer, but there are times he doesn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;ll go and do some research or go to the word of God and figure it out. You&rsquo;re going to find that there are a lot of people in school that will try to challenge you; they&rsquo;ll try to make you rethink your faith or try to make you feel like you&rsquo;re not as big of a believer as you think you are. My feeling is, if you don&rsquo;t know the answer, you should say, &ldquo;Hey, I don&#39;t know the answer, but we can figure it out together.&rdquo; That type of reply can change the outlook of the conversation. Understand that there are going to be some people who want to make you feel that your beliefs are inadequate, simply because they don&rsquo;t agree with you. That&rsquo;s not cool!&nbsp; For those people who don&#39;t believe, listen, I feel you; I get it. I&rsquo;m not discounting anything you say. We can still respect each other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was in college, I met a lot of people who didn&#39;t have any type of religious faith or background, but their reasoning was sound and it made sense. People would say to me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a Christian. I don&#39;t believe in God because my mom died at a young age.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&#39;t believe in God because I&#39;m gay and Christians hate gays.&rdquo; When I thought about these types of comments, I thought, &ldquo;Well, I have gay friends and I don&#39;t hate them.&rdquo; But there are people who just assumed and assigned that opinion to me because I am a Christian. That type of judgement is hurtful to all parties involved. I feel sad for people who have never given God the chance to show all that He can do. I feel bad for people who have a negative view of God. It pains me to know that they think that everybody who believes in God, everybody who believes in Jesus, acts and thinks just like that. I&#39;m here to tell you, I understand why you might feel like that, but it&rsquo;s not the truth! I understand why people who have had unfavorable experiences in the church don&rsquo;t believe. Please know that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the stories I heard involved people who made decisions not to go church because they felt that the church turned its back on them. Or maybe they went through an unplanned pregnancy and the church talked bad about them or about their family. What kind of church is that? If you think about your past, when it comes to any type of religious organization you&#39;re probably thinking the same thing: &lsquo;Yup, see, this is exactly why I don&#39;t go.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listen, not every single religious organization is like that. I don&#39;t belong to a &ldquo;religious organization&rdquo;; to me Christ is more than just a building. This is something I believe in, it&#39;s a lifestyle; it&rsquo;s following what Christ said. He said he wanted me to go into a body of believers where I can learn, grow and be held accountable, which is why I go to church. Everyone&#39;s reason for going to church is different. But I want you to know that if similar, negative situations or anything like that has happened to you, I&#39;m sorry. Christians are just like people of the world. Why? Because they are people of the world. Sometimes they do try to act like they&#39;re better and that they&#39;re without fault, but no Christian is perfect; just like no one else is perfect in the world. Christians sin, they gossip, they can be judgmental; all of those faults are the same as other people. So when you say those things about Christians, you are absolutely correct. As a Christian, I want to say that you&#39;re right. However, for the most part, at least from what I&#39;m shown, (and again, I can also be biased because I am a Christian) the thing about Christianity that might just be a little different is that people who are of the Christian faith are trying to do something different about their lives. At least they are trying too. They aren&rsquo;t perfect, but they are trying. Don&rsquo;t base your opinion on one person or one experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another point, I don&rsquo;t just listen to what Christians say. Christians can say whatever they want, I watch what Christians do! If you&rsquo;re considering a different faith or you&rsquo;re considering changing or discovering something new while you&#39;re in college, I would recommend that you do it.&nbsp; Watch how people live. If you&rsquo;re part of a student group and they welcome you into their fold, watch what they do and how they treat others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a student, with a religious background, is definitely an interesting experience when you get to campus. You&rsquo;re going to go through a whole lot of changes. You&#39;re going to question things that you have done or are doing. That doesn&rsquo;t make you a bad person. You <em>should </em>question, but you should also constantly be seeking God. If you come to college and everything&#39;s just fine, then that makes me question how close you are with God in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can recall one night at my college, the dance majors had a lingerie party and they invited me to it. I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have gone, but I did. The whole time I was there I was thinking, would God be pleased that I was here? In the flesh, yeah, I was happy to participate in this new experience, but I wondered how God felt. Still today, I would probably tell you that that party was awesome and unbelievable! But, think about it, why were college students even having a party like that? Why did I feel that I needed to be part of it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re trying to continue your faith when you come to campus, I briefly suggested earlier in this chapter that you check out the Christian organizations which are prominent on most college campuses. I&#39;ve been to Campus Crusade for Christ and I&#39;ve been to Cru. Any type of higher education institution probably has some religious organization that will fit your needs. For me, when I went to those organizations, they didn&#39;t really fit my needs. In fact, I felt really out of place and those people were Christians and so was I. What I had to do was find my own way of being able to grow with my peers, without having to go through the organizations that already existed. I found people on campus, who I felt were just like me and who had the same beliefs that I did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only will you find organizations that help with faith, you&#39;ll also find organizations that want to help tear down your faith. I remember there were two atheist organizations on my campus. I&rsquo;m sure a lot of you are thinking, &ldquo;How could you have two atheist&rsquo;s organizations?&rdquo; Well, one of the atheist groups was designed to say, &ldquo;Hey, we don&#39;t know what we believe; we just know that we believe in something&rdquo;; which, in my opinion, is more agnostic than anything. The other atheist group was specifically geared towards tearing down the religions of other people. Wow! No matter which organization or religion you&rsquo;re affiliated with, I don&#39;t believe any of them teach hate. I don&#39;t believe that any of them teach berating other people or demeaning other people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#39;ll start to realize that even though you believe in <em>your </em>God, that a lot of the concepts are similar when compared. God wants to heal you, God is loving, God wants you to be part of something that&#39;s bigger than you. He wants you to rely on Him instead of relying on yourself. For any of those organizations that are developed based on hate, I don&#39;t believe that those organizations are religiously grounded or have any type of religious roots. Pay attention to those types of behaviors or activities because there are also cults on college campuses and students are some of the easiest individuals to prey on and are easily susceptible. If you&rsquo;re really trying to figure out what organization to believe in or what organization to be a part of, do some research and watch what people do, not necessarily what they say.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can remember, on multiple campuses that I&#39;ve been to, that once a week, in the quad, they would have a campus preacher. If you&rsquo;re on a campus or have been on a campus in the past, you can probably recall a similar scenario. The campus preacher comes to campus, preaches the word of God, right out of the book. They normally preach from the Old Testament, which talks about gloom and doom &ndash; turn back from your sin now or you will receive the fiery brimstone known as Hell. Yeah, that&rsquo;s not how to win people to Christ; students weren&rsquo;t going for that. In fact, I think that the campus preacher if anything, deterred students from accepting any type of religious background or faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was one organization on one of the campuses that I worked at who actively came to campus, a public institution, and would preach hate. That&rsquo;s literally what they preached&hellip;.hate! I don&#39;t know what kind of group it was. Their goal was to incite a riot on campus so that students would fight them. They did this because they were protected by the First Amendment and if a student struck them on campus, they could then sue the institution. They had nothing to do with religion or any belief system whatsoever. These people were scammers and their main goal was to sue institutions; which they had done and gotten a big payday. So, students would beat them up and the cops would come and they would sue the campus. They would get in their Lamborghini and drive away. Come on, now! These people said they were there representing God; I don&rsquo;t think so! If you&rsquo;re a believer, you know that&rsquo;s not true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students, watch out for religious fanatics; they&#39;re everywhere! They want you to believe what they believe and they&#39;re super crazy! Listen, I&#39;m a Christian and I love God but I would be lying if I said that I 100% eat, breathe, sleep and poop God. It doesn&rsquo;t happen that way. I&#39;m human. I have imperfections. There are times when I&#39;m not keeping God in the forefront of my mind and life. There are times when I do things that are not very godly. If anything, I feel like that makes me more human and definitely more relatable. My suggestion is to watch out for those people who act like they don&#39;t have any faults and everything that they do is for God. Look for people who are genuine and authentic when they talk to you about their God. Honestly, these are probably the individuals that have a better scope and understanding of what it means to have faith and beliefs in something other than the world or themselves. Watch out for hate groups; they exist, don&rsquo;t join them! They&rsquo;re only there for the hate! Hate isn&rsquo;t cool, don&rsquo;t drink the &ldquo;haterade&rdquo;!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Know that your experiences, in regard to your faith, are never going to be the same as someone else&rsquo;s. People may share their journey of faith with you. It will not be the same as your journey! I know a lot of people said that when they came to college, they started to question God or question their religious background. That doesn&#39;t make you a bad person and it doesn&rsquo;t make you less than any other person in your faith. What it means is that you&#39;re human. If you&#39;re not questioning your faith, if you&rsquo;re not growing, if you&rsquo;re not having any doubts, that only shows that maybe you didn&rsquo;t have much faith to begin with. Even the strongest Christian or the strongest Muslim or the strongest Jewish person or the strongest whatever, has questions and doubts. We have to have true and authentic relationships with <em>our </em>God.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your faith may be tested in college. God might put you through some serious tests while you&rsquo;re in college. I was definitely put through the ringer. Was my faith tested? Absolutely! But it was tested for a reason. It was tested to help me grow. It was tested to teach me patience and to teach me how to rely on Him and not myself. It was tested to teach me how to withstand seduction and stand in the midst of adversity and temptation. And most importantly, it was tested to show me what Michael Thornhill was trying to show and teach me, all the way from the beginning. How badly do you want it?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you believe in a God? Do you have a moral compass? Are there things that give you hope when you wake up in the morning? For me, I pray before I go to bed with the hope and the faith that God will keep me and protect me throughout the night so that I&rsquo;ll be able to get up the next morning to continue to praise Him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2020-09-07 23:19:51', '2020-09-11 00:01:51', NULL);

(28, 6, 'I’m Just Depressed, No Big Deal', NULL, 20, '<p>I know a lot of you are probably thinking right now, &ldquo;How is Justin possibly going to write an entire chapter about depression?&rdquo; I can do it because depression and mental health are such complex issues that the topics can&#39;t possibly be covered in just a few pages. If you were thinking that thought, you are absolutely correct. It would be socially and academically irresponsible of me not to mention and explore depression because depression is real! That&#39;s right everybody, depression is real! For those of you who have gone through it, those who currently experience it or know someone who suffers from it, you know that it can change your entire outlook on life, your entire chemical make-up and your social perspective when it comes to dealing with other people. You may be asking yourself, &ldquo;Why is he saying it&#39;s real? Of course, it&#39;s real. Who would think that it&rsquo;s <em>not </em>real?&rdquo; You would be surprised that a lot of people think depression is not real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes when students are having a blue day or collection of bad days, they may come and chat with me. I usually say something to them like, &ldquo;Have you ever talked to anyone from the counseling center or have you talked to a therapist? You could be depressed.&rdquo; Some students are immediately in denial. &ldquo;No! I don&rsquo;t think depression is a real thing. I just need to get over this hump or I need to pray more or it&#39;s all in my head. I&rsquo;ve been thinking some negative thoughts lately. I simply need to think more positively.&rdquo; In some cases, those students are absolutely right. But when we see a prolonged negativity, consistent behavior of having down days, not acting like yourself, personality shifts, separating and isolating yourself from students, your peers and colleagues, changes in eating and sleeping habits, lack of interest in things that once brought you joy, or lack of normal interaction and conversation with others, it can be deduced that maybe there is a depression issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few tricky things when it comes to depression and if you&rsquo;ve ever gone through depression or seen someone with depression, you can probably relate. First, you never know when depression is going to manifest. For some people, like myself (and we&rsquo;ll get into that later in the chapter), you may have something called Seasonal Affective Disorder or seasonal depression. This is when everything is fine as long as the sun is out. If the sun is shining, you&rsquo;re doing great, you&#39;re flying high. But, when the season changes and the weather starts to change, when it gets a little colder, daylight is shorter, maybe the snow has started, the sky is filled with dark clouds and the sun is blocked out, you may start to feel depressed. It&#39;s not a choice, it just happens. As the seasons change, so does your mood, your attitude and your actions. The other concept is, if you&rsquo;ve been through depression, you know that it can sneak up on you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of if the depression is seasonal or not, depression doesn&#39;t have a set time or day when it happens. It doesn&#39;t work like that. For students who are used to life happening like clockwork or if you are timeframe oriented, throwing depression into the mix can be devastating. Depression is not something you can necessarily plan for; it just happens. It can occur due to unfortunate events that have happened in your life, like doing poorly on a test or having someone in your family pass away. There are many reasons depression can occur and it can hit anyone! Depression isn&rsquo;t partial to a certain race, gender, sexual orientation or religion. Depression has no names. It can harm or affect anyone!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, when your depression is nearing, you may not even recognize it. Why is that? When it comes to college students, depression can look like a few different moods. Depression can look like homesickness, drug or alcohol issues, an eating disorder or suicidal or negative thoughts, actions or behaviors. You all know that one person who is insanely negative, about EVERYTHING! Yes, depression can also look like that too. But sometimes, depression just looks like depression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to break these myths that depression is this notion where students are walking around acting like Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh or with dark rain clouds over their head. Sometimes the person doesn&#39;t look like that. Sometimes the person appears to be happy, a person who doesn&#39;t seem to let anything bother them or a person who doesn&rsquo;t seem to have anything wrong going on in their life. Sometimes depression can resemble a type of hopelessness when a student, all of a sudden, thinks, &ldquo;I don&#39;t need any of my stuff anymore. Go ahead and take something of mine that you like and you&rsquo;ll remember me by.&rdquo; That doesn&#39;t sound like someone who&#39;s depressed; that sounds like someone who might be suicidal. Depression can take form in someone who hasn&rsquo;t eaten for a while or someone who binge eats. Trends show that losing weight isn&rsquo;t traditionally what happens to college students. The majority of college students come to campus and <em>gain </em>weight. We&rsquo;ll talk more about weight gain in another chapter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember a situation when I was &ldquo;on call for duty rotation&rdquo; at an institution. I received a phone call from Public Safety to go to a certain building and check on a particular student. For this story, we&rsquo;ll call this student Brett. Brett&rsquo;s friends had placed a call to Public Safety. They made the call because they felt Brett was acting irrationally. He was saying things that made them uncomfortable. Most of the people involved with the call had been friends with Brett back in their hometown, through high school and now in college. Here they were, in their sophomore year in college, and they felt that Brett was acting really odd. Brett basically had an emotional breakdown. He was exhibiting random behavior like, trying to shower from the toilet, standing over them as they were sleeping and having some really weird conversations that they couldn&rsquo;t make any sense of. He was having some mental health issues and possibly depression. I&rsquo;m certain that depression played a part in the final outcome of his breakdown. I remember meeting with Brett and talking with him. He told me he wasn&rsquo;t Brett but that he was God Brett and unless I called him God Brett, he was not going to respond to me. I needed to help him, so I called him God Brett; it sounds a little silly but that&rsquo;s what he needed at that time. He told me that he wasn&rsquo;t doing well in school and he said there were a bunch of things that were going wrong in his life, but he also said that he felt great. Throughout our conversation, he never broke his smile; it was almost forced. When I looked him in the eyes, they appeared empty; like he wasn&rsquo;t really there.&nbsp; Ultimately, God Brett took some time off, away from campus; to get himself back together psychologically. I want to tell you that the God Brett situation, not necessarily all of it, is a scenario that is happening to students on college campuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Mental health is a real situation. Students need to take care of themselves, not only physically and intellectually, but also mentally. What does this mean? I know that school comes with a lot of pressure and demands on the students, especially for a student who has never had that type of pressure. We find students, coming to campus, who were able to breeze through high school easily, not study, come in, take the test and do well. In fact, some of their high schools were so small that they were probably the best in their class. Then they come to college and they&#39;re meeting the best people from all around the country and the game is a little different. Now they actually have to study, read the textbooks and take notes. Sometimes students are learning these skills for the first time, in college; not when they should have learned them in K-12. Some of this creates a lot of stress and pressure and some students can&#39;t take the pressure. Not being able to handle this pressure can absolutely hurt or harm students, especially during this transitional time, when they&#39;re trying so hard to be successful in this new environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Support from your loved ones is important. I say this because one thing I&rsquo;ve noticed in my years in college and working on a campus is there is not enough open and honest conversation between students and their families. A lot of parents will call their student and ask, &ldquo;Hey, how are you doing?&rdquo; And the student will respond with, &ldquo;Everything is great!&rdquo; This is another reason I thought this book would be beneficial. Parents need to be aware of the situations that are happening on our campuses. Parents should be aware and be able to address this with their son or daughter. Parents usually call their students once a day, once every other day, or once a week. Here is a typical phone conversation between a parent and their child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conversation goes as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mom: Hey Johnny. How are you doing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnny: Oh, hey mom. I&rsquo;m doing good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mom: Great, great. How are classes?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnny: Classes are going well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mom: Okay. So you&rsquo;re doing okay? You&rsquo;re making friends?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnny: Doing okay mom. Making friends. Everything&rsquo;s good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mom: Do you need anything?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnny: No, I don&rsquo;t need anything mom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mom: Great! Well, I&rsquo;ll talk to you soon. Bye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Little does Johnny&rsquo;s mom know, there are some bigger issues that are going on with Johnny. Johnny&#39;s parents aren&rsquo;t even aware of the situations that are going on until the next time they call Johnny and Johnny doesn&rsquo;t pick up. And they try to call Johnny again and he doesn&rsquo;t answer&hellip;again. Then the parent goes on Johnny&rsquo;s social media to see if they can figure out what&rsquo;s going on. This brings up another subject. Parents, although I&rsquo;ve previously mentioned allowing your child to figure out life on their own, if you see a dramatic change, you may want to be a bit more intrusive; especially, considering your child is away at school. You can&rsquo;t necessarily be intrusive with their academics, because as we know, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act<strong> </strong>prevents us, as professionals, from giving you that information, but be intrusive when it comes to their development. Going away to college is a huge change for students; socially, psychologically and mentally. Be aware of any shifts in your child&rsquo;s behavior. We, as student affairs professionals, are paying attention too; you are not alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are plenty of ways to alleviate mental health and depression related issues. Some people believe that you can fix the issues through prayer and, yes, sometimes that can work. While prayer can definitely help a mental health or depression situation, it&rsquo;s not a guaranteed fix. Sometimes the person needs a little more than prayer. Sometimes medication is necessary.&nbsp; I say medication with pause. I am not an advocate for anyone going out and buying pills on their own, off the street. That&rsquo;s not safe. I understand how the pharmaceutical companies work: they want you to keep buying pills, buying pills and buying more pills, until you can&rsquo;t live without them. That is not what I&rsquo;m suggesting. What I am suggesting, is that if someone does have a chemical imbalance, they might need some help which can only happen with the aid of prescribed medication. Please, please please, make sure that you also consult a counselor, therapist, psychologist or other medically trained professional, <em>before</em> you take any type of medication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that support from friends and family is also extremely important. Sometimes people just want to be heard and to know that the people around them are supporting them and are there for them. People don&rsquo;t always want an answer to their problems either; they may want to just vent and talk it through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Counseling is certainly important. There is nothing like talking to someone that you don&rsquo;t know, who is objective to your situation and has been trained to help people deal with issues and give you the professional guidance and support you need. Talking to your mom or dad or your friends is fine, but talking to a seasoned professional, who sees individuals going through mental health and depression issues every day is super beneficial. I myself have even done counseling before and I can tell you that counseling was unequivocally beneficial for me. If you know someone who needs counseling, letting them know that it&rsquo;s an option or suggesting it as an option is not a negative connotation. I think sometimes we look at counseling as a negative option, as if, &ldquo;Oh, if I go to counseling then something&#39;s wrong with me,&rdquo; or &ldquo;If I see a therapist, I&rsquo;m weak.&rdquo; No! If anything, you&#39;re going to counseling so you can get help and <em>that</em> makes you strong. When you&#39;re hungry, you go to a food store so you can get food, right? So why would you deprive yourself of going somewhere where you can be fed the nourishment you need, that will help your situation, allowing you to feel better overall?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depression and mental health issues can really mess you up, especially if you allow it to linger, not tell anyone that you&rsquo;re feeling this way and may need help. I&rsquo;m bringing up these issues because, again, I told you that I suffer from seasonal depression. This wasn&#39;t something that I suffered from growing up as a kid. I think it was because I grew up in an area that doesn&rsquo;t see too much snow. Then I went to a school where it was completely different. Let me tell you, if there wasn&#39;t fourteen inches of snow on the ground every week, I wouldn&#39;t have known what university I was at; we always had snow. It was rare, except for the summer time, that you would see the sun (and no snow!). I think not getting enough sun exposure and always seeing the snow changed my mood and behavior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember as a college student I became depressed. I&rsquo;m sure some people are thinking, &lsquo;Oh my gosh! That&#39;s so scary! You were depressed in college! You were far away from your mom and dad and nobody was around to help you!&rsquo; If that&rsquo;s what you thought, you are absolutely correct, that&rsquo;s how it was! So what happened? Well, first off, I had to get the help that I needed. I had to admit to myself that something wasn&rsquo;t right, I was not feeling like myself; I was not sleeping or eating the same way. If anything, even if I couldn&rsquo;t see my depression, my friends certainly could. If you notice significant changes in your close friends, peers, or colleagues, you have to speak up and be a bystander. Being a bystander means that you get directly involved, which also means you have to let them know what you&rsquo;re seeing. And guess what? They may not listen to you, but that&rsquo;s okay because you did the right thing. Your job is to speak up and make them aware that you noticed these changes and that you want to be there to support and help them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides weather, depression can come from life changes. It can come from lack of funds or money, especially during the college years when we all know that money can be in short supply.&nbsp; Depression can come from family or school issues. Sometimes there may be a death, or maybe you&rsquo;re still affected by some baggage that you brought from home. In general, school can affect you when you&#39;re not getting the grades that you want or you&#39;re being spread around too thin or classes are new and the material is difficult. Depression can come from having a chemical imbalance. It can come from having bad relationships with people in college. It can even come from weight gain or low self-esteem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember a day in particular at an institution I worked at.&nbsp; I worked with a student who had been cutting herself. I didn&#39;t know that she was cutting herself because her arm was full of band aids and she wore hoodies. It wasn&rsquo;t until one day when campus police called me and asked me to come down and speak with her. It seemed that her boyfriend had stolen her car. When I tried to talk to her about the situation, she laughed through the whole thing as if it was a joke. It wasn&#39;t until I began asking her some more pointed questions about the situation that she start breaking down and crying. The police had asked her several questions and she lied to the police. One of the questions that the police asked her was, &ldquo;Is there any abuse happening in your relationship?&rdquo; She told the police no, but when I asked her the more pointed questions, the ones that were very direct and open ended, it kind of broke down her shell a little bit. We ultimately found out that this young lady was being abused by her boyfriend and she was probably suffering from depression. She later went on to show me that she had cuts on her arm. One cut was bad enough that I suggested that she go to a medical care facility to get the wound treated. She didn&#39;t even know that that wound, which she had inflicted, was infected. She was cutting herself because of the situation with her boyfriend and because of depression. I&#39;m happy to note that after a few months of therapy, counseling, medication and some time away from her boyfriend, she was able to get herself back on track. She graduated with honors. She also got her car back, as the police later found it and they were able to arrest the young man. The man was later permanently banned from campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many different resources on campus, for students, should they want to talk to somebody. Any campus student affairs professional or faculty and staff should be willing to help any student who is having an issue. If they can&rsquo;t directly help the student, they should be trained well enough to point them in the right direction to get the resources they need to be successful. Some of these resources include, but are not limited to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Counseling center</strong> - Every campus, around the country has a counseling center. Some counseling centers have walk-in hours where you can just walk in and talk to a counselor, but others require that you have an appointment. Counseling centers can be tricky because there are a lot of students, who are bringing a bevy of problems. There isn&rsquo;t really isn&rsquo;t a quiet time of day. If you need help, make sure you go as soon as possible and get the help you need. The counseling center knows that they&#39;re spread thin and they try their best to make sure everybody is seen. I haven&#39;t had any negative experiences with a counseling center, not only as a student affairs professional but also when I utilized them as a student. The only negative I can mention is that, like I said, there are a lot of students, with a lot of problems and only a few counseling centers to utilize. They try their best to accommodate everybody, but they can only do so much. You can&rsquo;t really fault the counseling center if they can&#39;t see you on the same day you need. They also have to adhere to the gravity of each situation. Sometimes situations pop up on college campuses where the counseling center needs to intervene immediately, versus other situations where we hope the student can wait a few hours before the counselor can talk to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Health Care Center</strong> - You can also go to the health care center located on your local campus. They have some tools, resources and individuals available there who are willing to instruct you in the right way, in regard to your mental health and depression. You will probably experience similar trends in the staff being overloaded, but they are there to help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we discussed earlier, students are bringing many issues with them to campus. Students, be your own advocate. If you find that life is getting too hard, college life is too much to handle or if you&rsquo;re not finding the same joy that you used to feel before you got to college, and something is just different or feels off, I would highly encourage you to explore these feelings. Go and talk to somebody who can help you. Talk to your parents or guardians. Talk to your friends. Find out what&rsquo;s going on because it may be something that needs to be addressed. Parents, pay close attention to your children. Keep an eye out for estranged behavior, drastic changes in actions, rhythms or daily activities with your child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, depression isn&rsquo;t something that has a definitive or specific look. Depression doesn&rsquo;t necessarily look like someone who&#39;s just sitting in the corner with the lights off, with a knife, in a storm, with a black cloud following them. I think that&#39;s the picture we all conjure up when we think of depression and that&rsquo;s why it always sounds so negative. Depression can happen to anyone, anywhere at any time. You would be shocked at the amount of people you know who suffer with depression, but have never brought it up or talked to you about it. This is why it&#39;s such an important issue that we need to continue to face and tackle by having open and instructive dialogues and conversations. The stigma that comes from back in the old days before depression and mental illness were properly handled, was to put sufferers in institutions and heavily medicating them! There is a certain stigma surrounding mental health that is never really acknowledged or talked about. It&rsquo;s treated as something that you should be embarrassed about. Should someone with diabetes or heart disease or even cancer be embarrassed? No! Then why would someone with mental illness be expected to feel that way? Let&rsquo;s deal with the stigma people, that way we can help those who are in need.</p>', '2020-09-07 23:20:10', '2020-09-11 00:01:35', NULL),
(29, 6, 'My Roomie Is My Bestie', NULL, 20, '<p>Roommates can be super fun! Listen, I know a lot of you are probably very anxious and hesitant about having a roommate. You may have heard about bad roommate situations and the crazy stories that go along with bad roommates, and of course, this chapter will include some of those stories. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard about the life-changing, uncomfortable situations that are caused by roommates and, yes, those situations definitely happen. What you may not hear about are the good stories about the great roommates. You don&rsquo;t hear about the lifelong friends you make or that first roommate you meet in college who ends up being in your wedding and a godparent to your children. Those are not the stories you normally hear. I believe that those are the more common roommate situations that take place in college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a roommate can be an intensely new experience, especially for those who didn&#39;t grow up with siblings. Now you have a shared living space; you have rules and guidelines that need to be established between the roommates sharing that space. You have to create and then ensure that the two (or four) of you are living in a unified space together and everyone&#39;s needs are being met. Without rules and guidelines, chaos and dysfunction would be produced in your otherwise harmonious living space. Believe me, no one wants to live in a dysfunctional living space. You want to be comfortable in your own room. You want to feel safe. You want to feel like your room is set up the way you like it. Why is this? For most people, your home is where your peace is. When you&#39;ve had a stressful day of classes or while you&#39;re out and about, you want to know that you can come home to a place that you feel comfortable in, you feel safe in and where you can have peace. Having that one comfortable, peaceful place is essential to your success as a student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to create that harmonious living space, you have to learn people. You&rsquo;re no longer living in a room by yourself, you&rsquo;re living with someone else. Someone who might like a different air temperature than you, someone who has a different sleeping pattern than you, someone who may even have different cleaning standards than you. All of this means that you&#39;re going to have to take the time to learn a new normal in your new space. You&#39;re going to have to learn the habits of a new person and learn how to co-exist. You can only do that through engaging, interactive conversations with your roommate to learn and get to know them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everybody has different situations and no roommate is perfect. Sometimes you hear people say things like, &ldquo;Well, I had the perfect roommate when I was in my first year.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I had the perfect roommate in college.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no such thing as perfect. Every situation is new and different. Some people think if they lived with a particular person, everything would be fine. As if they could change their living situation and the grass would be greener! My response to that would be that the grass can be greener on any side as long as you fertilize it; meaning that you need to put the time and effort into really learning how to live in your new space with a new person. This also means that you need to compromise. Compromising means everybody wins. You don&#39;t get 100% of what you want, but the other person doesn&rsquo;t get 100% of what they want either; it&rsquo;s a win-win!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most universities recommend that roommates make something called &ldquo;A Roommate Contract&rdquo;. Basically, this entails you and your roommate, during the first night or week that you&rsquo;re on campus, coming up with a set of rules and guidelines that you both promise to uphold and agree to so that everybody can live in this space and be happy. Some of these rules and guidelines might include: what time you both plan on going to bed, who&#39;s going to restock toiletries, who plans on using the T.V. at a certain time, what you will do about food and trash. This contract can also include things like when guests are allowed to come over or when guests are not allowed to come over. You both need to make sure that you&rsquo;re adequately following the contract that you set up because if there is a particular situation, these contracts can really help resolve a disagreement between you and your roommate. It&rsquo;s all there in black and white.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me tell you a story about some residents who did not take these contracts seriously. I can remember a story where for every single question asked, the resident would reply, &ldquo;I&#39;m a do me!&rdquo; So I said, &ldquo;What time are you going to go sleep?&rdquo; Resident said, &ldquo;I&#39;m a do me!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;What time are you going to allow guests to come over?&rdquo; Resident, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a do me!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;What time is phone time shut off?&rdquo; Resident, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a do me!&rdquo; When the time came for the roommates to actually have a conversation about the issues that were bothering both of them, the only reaction to every single situation was, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a do me!&rdquo; Now the time came for me, as the resident director, to step in, and I couldn&#39;t; I just had to do me. Do you get it now? These contracts are essential in setting up expectations and guidelines so you all can live together in a room and for it to be an incredible experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People come to college from different upbringings. They come from different ways of being raised, different perspectives, cultures, backgrounds and areas. All of these differences play a part in how individuals live. When you start living with people, you&rsquo;ll see how different they are from you. It isn&#39;t only how they were raised or where they come from. They might be extremely independent and have different habits that you just might not like or may not be accustomed to. You won&rsquo;t learn or understand these habits until you start talking to the person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I recall a story about a mother calling the Residence Life Department at the institution because she was scared that her son&rsquo;s roommate was a cannibal. Yes, you heard that right, a cannibal! How did she come to determine this? She found out this information because she went onto her son&rsquo;s Facebook page and looked up his roommate. For those of you in this situation who just found out your roommate&rsquo;s name, do not go on social media to look up stuff about them. This will only result in you making judgments about the person before you even have a chance to get to know them. That&#39;s not fair to do that; get to know them. You don&rsquo;t want someone doing that to you, do you? So, the roommates Facebook page said: Hobbies &ndash; Cannibalism. The mother was scared for her son&rsquo;s safety. When the person who told me the story looked up the cannibal&rsquo;s schedule, she also saw that he had a meal plan so he wasn&#39;t necessarily eating people. They did call him in anyway, just to see what was going on. They said, &ldquo;Hey. We have some concerns about your Facebook page. It says that you&rsquo;re into cannibalism. Do you eat people?&rdquo; And the guy just laughed and said no, but he finds cannibalism interesting and he&rsquo;s done a good amount of research and work surrounding it. So you can see how people can form preconceived notions about other people without even giving them a chance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roommates sometimes fight over the dumbest things. I can recall a story about two residents fighting over a towel bar. One of the girls, we&rsquo;ll call her Chelsea, had a towel bar that was on the other side of the room and Megan, her roommate, had a towel bar right above her bed. Well Chelsea decided she <em>had</em> to use the towel bar above Megan&#39;s bed. And Megan said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to use the towel bar above my bed. I&#39;m going to use it as my towel bar. Use the one across the room.&rdquo; Chelsea didn&rsquo;t want to do that. They fought over this towel bar, for at least two months. It was crazy because I couldn&#39;t understand why these two were fighting over a towel bar. That&rsquo;s an example of one of the simplest things that roommates fight over. They can fight over the silliest things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some other examples of disagreements were over food, T.V. time, noise, the lights being on or off, the temperature in the room, and too many guests. All of these things come into play when it comes to living with someone. Again, what is essential is making sure you are having these conversations with your roommate before you start living with each other. If it can&rsquo;t happen before you start rooming together, make sure you do it as soon as possible. Make the expectations clear and concise. For example: On your contract, if it says what time should the lights go out, you shouldn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;When we get tired.&rdquo; People get tired at different times at any point in the day, depending on how heavy your schedule is. Set a specific time: All lights out by 12:00 a.m. or 1:00 a.m., up for negotiation on the weekends. Both of you are a part of the contract rules and guidelines. Don&rsquo;t just agree to be agreeable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the most important thing that roommates should do is communicate. How do you live, sleep and be in the same room with someone who you don&rsquo;t talk to? Isn&rsquo;t that awkward? I&rsquo;m sure people do it all the time, but in any healthy relationship, communication is key. You need to communicate your needs, your wants and dislikes. You can&rsquo;t hold someone accountable if they didn&rsquo;t know the expectation to begin with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember a situation where there was a young lady who we&rsquo;ll call Alicia. She was rooming with another young lady, Jackie. Alicia had a boyfriend back at home, we&rsquo;ll say his name was Steve. Alicia and Steve had dated and had a great relationship, but he broke up with her right before the first semester started. Her roommate, Jackie, knew that Alicia and Steve had broken up, but Jackie never took the time to find out why Alicia was crying or upset. She really didn&rsquo;t communicate with her at all. Two weeks later, Jackie found a boyfriend and asked Alicia if the new boyfriend could come over to hang out and of course, Alicia said yes. Two minutes later, Jackie walked in with Steve. How crazy and coincidental is that?! It&#39;s kind of like a lightning strikes twice situation, where both roommates were dating the same guy. I know it sounds like an extreme situation, but it happened. Because the roommates didn&#39;t know enough about each other or enough about what was going on in each other&rsquo;s lives, an awkward situation arose. A little communication would have solved the whole problem of dating the same guy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With communication also comes realistic expectations. Some students that room together, clearly, have never lived with someone else before. I&rsquo;m sure there are a number of students who are an only child and, not to give people who are an only child a complex, but this may be the first time they&rsquo;ve ever had to share a space or share items with someone else. This is a new developmental experience for them, but having realistic expectations is certainly helpful. You can&rsquo;t come in and think you&rsquo;re going to get 100% of what you ask for and everything is going to go the way you want it to. That&rsquo;s just simply not going to happen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember two young ladies who were set to be roommates. When it was time for them to make their roommate contract, the one just had completely unrealistic expectations as to how they were going to live in the room. She wanted the roommate to go to bed at 10 p.m.; all lights off. She didn&rsquo;t want the other roommate to have friends over in the room, ever! And she said she didn&rsquo;t want her to use her cell phone in the room, she had to use it in the hallway. She also didn&rsquo;t like the sound of people chewing so she didn&rsquo;t want her roommate to chew in the room. I&rsquo;m thinking, you cannot ask all these things of someone else. When the other roommate expressed that she wanted some of these liberties, the one roommate just said, &ldquo;Absolutely not! If you don&rsquo;t like it, you can move out!&rdquo; As a side note, residence life and housing services, at any institution, would not allow that, nor would they indulge that type of behavior. When roommates are together, there has to be some type of compromise or agreement and equality for both sides. That young lady had some really unrealistic expectations and that does happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the students who are reading this, if you ever have a problem, go to your resident assistant, community assistant, resident director or hall advisor. That&#39;s what they&#39;re there for: to help you navigate how to have these healthy relationships with your roommate, because let&rsquo;s be honest, sometimes your roommates can be unreasonable. Students should come in with a clean slate and an open mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know a lot of people say not to room with your best friend. Why not room with your best friend? People say it has the potential to ruin your relationship and it will never be the same again. As someone who has been in student affairs for about ten years and been in residence life and housing services for about five years, I will tell you that this is not necessarily 100% true. Your friendship will only get ruined if <em>you allow </em>it to be ruined. It&#39;s a great experience to room with someone you know. Yes, you will definitely get to know them in a totally different light and on a different level, just like you&#39;ll get to know any roommate. Your friendship will only fall apart and be ruined if you allow it to be. If you go into the situation with set expectations and you have open communication, you&#39;ll be perfectly fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I went to college and I roomed with my best friend from high school. He and I decided to go to the same university, decided to room together and, surprise, we&#39;re still best friends today. Did we have arguments and disagreements? Absolutely! We still have arguments and disagreements today and we don&rsquo;t live with each other anymore. You&#39;re going to have arguments and disagreements with people. It could be your significant other, your parents, your friends, your roommates; disagreements are going to happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would be lying if I said nothing happened between me and my roommate. My roommate, who is and was my best friend, did the triple jump in Track &amp; Field. He would come home and, there would be sand in his shoes. Instead of kicking the sand off outside the room, he would kick it off inside our room. I&#39;m a neat freak! I&rsquo;m crazy! Kind of like that guy from &ldquo;The Voice&rdquo; who always uses hand sanitizer on his hands. Look, I&rsquo;m a germaphobe. I probably clean my room three times a day where he might not clean his room three times a month. We had to make a compromise. We talked about certain situations that had occurred. For me, I had to try and be realistic about it; all the sand was not going to be left outside the room. At the same time, he tried his best to make sure not to bring too much sand in the room. That&rsquo;s a compromise! That&rsquo;s an example of two people having their expectations met. That&rsquo;s being able to communicate. We took the necessary time to make sure the issue didn&rsquo;t turn into something bigger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like any other situation, it will depend on how you handle the situation and how mature you are about it. Yes, I&rsquo;ve seen people who&#39;ve gone to college and roomed with their best friend and it turned out absolutely ugly; it didn&#39;t work out, at all! Whether you already know your roommate or not, it&rsquo;s all about what you make of the situation. If you put the work in and have open communication, a strong contract and are able to compromise, you&rsquo;ll be fine regardless of who the roommate is. Of course, there will be some situations where you&rsquo;re just not going to be able to effectively communicate with your roommate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember a situation where there was a young lady who screamed in her sleep. I don&rsquo;t know if she was experiencing night terrors. I don&rsquo;t know if it was due to something she was watching before she went to sleep. Whatever the reason, she would wake up in the middle of the night and start screaming or talking loudly in her sleep. This bothered her roommate. Not everything&#39;s going to be able to be fixed with a conversation. Ultimately, this young lady had to go on some medication and get some counseling. Again, not everything&#39;s going to be able to be fixed based on a conversation, but you have to let people know that the situation is taking place and that there are issues. The issues aren&rsquo;t going to go away just because you ignore them or because you talk about them once. Sometimes, you have to get other people involved. Bottom line - COMMUNICATE!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advice for students: It&rsquo;s not always the other person. Point to yourself right now and say, &ldquo;Hey, sometimes it may be me!&rdquo; Ouch! I know that hurts and it&rsquo;s a hard pill to swallow. Especially because our perception is our reality and it&rsquo;s easier for it to be someone else&rsquo;s fault; that&rsquo;s human nature. As soon as something bad happens, we immediately want to point the finger at someone else. It makes sense, I get it. It&rsquo;s not only college students who do that; adults do the same thing. This is something that happens no matter how old you are. And, because perception <em>is </em>our reality, if we think its someone else&rsquo;s fault, we automatically believe that. Remember, it could be you! It may be our inability to be flexible or our inability to compromise or our unwillingness to communicate. With all that said, I&rsquo;m going to say, &ldquo;Students, be flexible! Learn how to compromise! Be open! It can&rsquo;t be a &lsquo;this or that&rsquo; thing, it can&#39;t be a &lsquo;black or white&rsquo; thing. There will always be a grey area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know it may be hard and some of you may not be straightforward people. You may not like experiencing confrontation or conflict or maybe you don&rsquo;t want to hurt someone else&rsquo;s feelings. That&rsquo;s not what this is about. It&#39;s about making sure that everyone has the same information, that you&#39;re being transparent and that you&#39;re having these conversations. I&#39;m not going to sit here and lie to you. It&rsquo;s not easy! How do you tell your roommate that sometimes they smell? Or how do you tell your roommate that they&#39;re not cleaning up after themselves? Or that they&#39;re using your toilet paper? Or that they&rsquo;re wearing your clothes? These are all situations that could happen. COMMUNICATE!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advice for parents: I encourage you NOT to get involved in roommate situations, unless of course, it&rsquo;s life threatening. I can honestly say that 99.9% of the time, it is not life threatening. Don&rsquo;t get involved! Encourage your child to talk openly with their roommate. Encourage your son or daughter to talk to their resident assistant, the resident advisor, or the resident hall director. This will only help the student develop the competencies they need to have a conversation, but will also help with approaching conflict, dealing with confrontation and to be an advocate for themselves. It&rsquo;s all part of moving away to college and living with a roommate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t look up your son or daughter&rsquo;s roommate on social media. Don&rsquo;t judge them before you even meet them. That will only create animosity, fear and anxiety in your heart about who your child is going to be living with. Give everyone a chance! When I say give everyone a chance, I mean give <em>everyone</em> a chance! I&#39;m also talking about people from different races and backgrounds. You have no idea how many times our office gets called because a parent doesn&rsquo;t want their child living with a particular individual because they&#39;re gay or because they&rsquo;re black or because they belong to this certain religion. Get over yourselves, okay! If this doesn&rsquo;t apply to you, don&rsquo;t wear the shoe! But, for those of you who think that your son or daughter is going to be &ldquo;tainted&rdquo; because they&#39;re rooming with someone who has a different background that is so not true! If that were the case, then they&rsquo;re going to be tainted by anybody at the university and furthermore, anyone in the world! Students come from unique and different backgrounds, sexual orientations and religions. That&#39;s what colleges and universities are: a very unique place that is worth the collective minds of the greatest students from around the country coming together. Give your student the opportunity to have a diverse experience; don&#39;t take that away from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last, but not least, parents, you have to understand that not every situation is bad. Your child is going to have to figure it out on their own! What does that mean? It means, give them a chance to figure it out on their own! We want the students to think globally. We want them to experiment. We want them to figure out how to communicate. These things will only happen when we allow them to do it. We need you to help the residence hall directors and resident assistants. Why? Because those individuals are trying to make sure that they are sending the same message to your children. Don&rsquo;t work against us by sending different messages. Don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to call the president and make sure that this situation is fixed immediately!&rsquo; (Don&rsquo;t be that parent)! Don&rsquo;t do that because it sends mixed messages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s so funny when parents call the president. Like the president knows your situation or knows that your son or daughter is unhappy. Don&rsquo;t start with the president. No! If you feel you absolutely <em>have </em>to get involved, start with the first line of defense; call the resident director or call someone in student life. We can handle it at our level, if necessary; that&rsquo;s what we do! That&rsquo;s not to say that if you call the president, it won&rsquo;t be handled. The president has so many things to handle, he or she shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about your son or daughter being unhappy with the temperature in their room or your son or daughter having a towel rack issue! We understand that you spend a lot of money to send your child to school, so use the resources that you&rsquo;re paying for and go to the people who can help you; give them the opportunity to do what they&rsquo;re good at. We want to serve you. Give us the opportunity and the time to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, roommates are fun. They allow you to learn new things about others and about yourself. Again, a lot of roommate situations end with the individuals becoming best friends and rooming with each other again the next year. This is how lifelong friends are made. There&rsquo;s only those few times and those handful of crazy stories that you hear about that are over-the-top!&nbsp; Allow yourself to get to know someone, to grow, and to have fun. That&rsquo;s what college is all about, right?</p>', '2020-09-07 23:21:03', '2020-09-11 00:01:24', NULL);

(30, 6, 'Death', NULL, 20, '<p>I know this may seem pretty scary to be reading a college book that talks about death, but death can still happen when you&rsquo;re in college. No parent or student thinks that they&rsquo;re going to go to college and die. That&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s supposed to happen at college. You go to college so that you can get a degree, learn, develop, meet new people, graduate and have fun! Unfortunately, death is a real thing that happens on college campuses. Since it&rsquo;s not sexy and can&rsquo;t be packaged with a nice bow to market to people, most institutions don&#39;t talk much about death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t you think parents would be hesitant to send their child away to college if they thought death could become a reality while they were there? However, as an author, and as a person who works in student affairs, I try not to sugarcoat anything. Death is definitely a realistic circumstance that can happen to students all across the country. It&rsquo;s something that needs to be talked about. Why does it need to be talked about? Death doesn&#39;t stop or not happen just because the student is in college; it still happens. I know this sounds like a terrible thing to say, it&#39;s a terrible thing to hear but it&#39;s a truth. Family members can die while your child is away at college and unfortunately, sometimes students die at college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes they die off campus, sometimes they die during winter, Thanksgiving or spring break and sometimes family members die while students are away at college. Death happens. It&rsquo;s something that can be very painful, it hurts and it can definitely shake up a campus community and a family. Consider the fact that these students are interacting with each other on a daily basis. They&#39;re living with each other. They&#39;re socializing and communicating with each other. Then, poof, an incident takes place and someone is gone. A lot of these situations when death occurs, on a college campus, could have been prevented. I would like to say that the majority of them should be prevented, but some situations can&rsquo;t be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of you are probably thinking, &ldquo;Justin, how does death happen on campus? What are some of the situations that you&rsquo;ve experienced?&rdquo; I can tell you this: there are some deaths that are avoidable and then some deaths that just simply aren&rsquo;t. When I mention that some deaths are avoidable, I&rsquo;m thinking of situations where a student becomes so intoxicated that they get behind the wheel of a car and they kill themselves. That situation can definitely be avoided. If you&#39;re going to drink, stay where you are and don&#39;t get behind the wheel of a car, or have a DD (Designated Driver). That&rsquo;s a type of death that could be avoided. When I think about a death that can&rsquo;t be avoided, some students may have health issues, such as cancer. Cancer is something that can&rsquo;t be avoided and could take the life of a student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a death occurs on campus, I want to let students know it&#39;s okay to hurt, it&rsquo;s okay to cry. I think when we&rsquo;re in college, we&rsquo;re already vulnerable with the new experience. Sometimes this makes it difficult for us to show that we are even more vulnerable, especially when death occurs. Everybody handles death differently and sometimes that grief can be triggered by different things that happen on campus. I want to give a few examples of the deaths that I&#39;ve experienced in the field, just to give you a realistic expectation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we discussed in a previous chapter, depression and mental illness are an issue. Sometimes the pressures of being in school or the pressures of life are too hard and a student may make an attempt at taking their own life. I&rsquo;ve been on a few campuses where a student decided the pain was too much and they committed suicide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember on one of the campuses I&rsquo;ve been to, a student hung themselves in a closet. It&rsquo;s so sad when a person feels there is no hope for their life. I recall a student who jumped off of an academic building. Again, a horribly sad situation where the person just didn&rsquo;t feel like they had anything left, like there was no hope. These are both awful tragedies and&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t want to hear about them, but this is a reality. I&rsquo;m sure some institutions try to cover these types of situations up or at least keep them from the media. A situation like that could lead to bad publicity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>College is supposed to be a happy time for learning and exploring, not for dying. They don&rsquo;t want to talk about students dying on campus. Similar to the chapter on Safety, no one wants to talk about our campuses potentially being unsafe. If campuses are unsafe and students are dying, then the school is not going to bring in money. College is a place for learning, development, growth and of course, a degree. Colleges and universities are also money making entities. They are businesses and like any business, it almost always boils down to money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are millions and millions of dollars in cash flow circulating through institutions across the country. There&rsquo;s no money in death. There&rsquo;s no money in a place being unsafe. Like any good marketing plan, they paint the pictures of campuses that seem like they are growing and thriving and safe places to be; and for the most part they are. However, there is no place and no college campus that is exempt from death or exempt from safety issues happening. That&rsquo;s why it&#39;s important that we have these conversations. I think that a lot of times we get so comfortable in our world, not only on college campuses but in the world in general, that we forget that there are some ugly situations happening in life. If we&#39;re not emotionally prepared for them or if we&#39;re not mentally ready for these situations, we could really be caught off guard and greatly affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;d like to remind everyone that death should not be a reason for a student to dropout of school. I recall a student whose roommate passed away due to an unknown medical condition. They had become best friends. We talked about roommates in the previous chapter and a lot of people who are roommates become best friends. You come home to the same person every day. When you have a test you did poorly on, that&#39;s the first person you talk to. When you wake up that&#39;s the first person you see. When you go to bed, that&rsquo;s the last person you talk to. I remember the surviving roommate just couldn&#39;t deal. She couldn&rsquo;t take the pressure and the grief of her best friend not being there and ultimately, she dropped out of school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Death not only happens on campus, but it can happen at home, while you&rsquo;re away at college. Students have lost a parent, sibling, grandparent or a friend and they determine that they can no longer handle the stresses of being on campus. They feel like they need to be with their family immediately, and they drop out of school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a lot of differing conclusions about what happens after a death. They may feel that students have to do what&rsquo;s best for them. I would argue this point. Life is hard, no one wants to deal with death, but life doesn&rsquo;t stop when someone dies, the world keeps on spinning. That&rsquo;s a hard reality to hear and it&rsquo;s a hard message to comprehend. Do you think, for one second, that the person who died wants you to stop your life and dropout of school? No! I also remember a student who had to drop out because her grandmother died and her siblings didn&#39;t have anywhere else to live. She had to go home and get a job so she could financially provide for her siblings. I understand this situation, it sucks, but it makes sense. It was painful for me to watch her drop out of school, especially because she was extremely smart and I knew she had a bright future ahead of her. I always hoped she she was able to return to her studies at some point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would encourage students that even if death does take place during your time in college and to that point, no matter what happens when you go to college, you need to get that piece of paper! Get certified in the field you chose. There&rsquo;s nothing in this world that should stop you from your ultimate goal. I realize school is not the end all be all and yes, there may be other things that are more pressing than an education, but if at all possible, finish your degree. There is no point in starting if you are not going to complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember that balance is key. Maybe your goal is on pause for a minute or held up for a little while due to your circumstances, but no matter what takes place, you need to ensure that you complete the objective of getting your degree. Otherwise, you went to college and gave them your money for nothing. There are even students who dropout of school because they&#39;re not doing well academically. You can sit at home for free, you don&rsquo;t have to go to school. My heart hurts and breaks for these students that come to school, spend all this money and walk away with nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In freshman orientation, they say, &ldquo;Look to your left. Look to your right. One of these students will not be here at the end of the semester.&rdquo; I think that&#39;s crap! I hate that they say that! I hate that colleges and universities still do that. I feel like they&rsquo;re being cruel to first year students. I wish we could say, &ldquo;Look to your left, look to your right. Everyone is going to be here in two years. Everyone is going to graduate in four years.&rdquo; Now, granted, not everyone will stay at the same institution, so it does make a little sense, but let&rsquo;s show some positivity! Some of these students will transfer or some of the students will change their major. I never want to put it in a student&#39;s&#39; mind from the beginning that someone is going to fail. No! We all need to do this together and we all need to pull together as a community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember one of the sweetest students that I&#39;ve ever met. I have to bring her up in this chapter because she meant a lot to me. She died due to some health complications from having a seizure. It was so sudden. She was such a good student; never had any academic issues. She was highly involved on campus. She was sweet and kind, but she suffered from some medical issues. One night, out of no fault of her own and due to complications from her health issue, she unfortunately, passed away. I still think about her often, and fondly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also accidental deaths that happen on campus at institutions. I recall a student who was drunk and walked into a landfill. He was killed by one of the machines. Sure, I know students get drunk and sometimes throw up, but if you&rsquo;re watching out for your friends, this doesn&rsquo;t have to happen. I remember a situation where a student threw up but they were laying on their back. Since they were laying on their back, the vomit had nowhere to go and ultimately, they choked to death on their own vomit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another possible cause of death is disease. Some diseases are preventable by vaccination. If you&#39;re going to be living around other students, make sure that you&#39;re vaccinated. Not being vaccinated before you go off to college may not end well. You&rsquo;re going to have so many encounters with a lot of different people. You&#39;re shaking hands, high-fiving, touching a lot of computers, door handles, and sitting at desks. People get sick. Make sure you have all your regular immunizations and seasonal vaccinations as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some campuses and universities don&#39;t even let their students on campus unless they show proof that they&rsquo;ve had all of the necessary vaccinations. It&#39;s important! The meningitis vaccination is the most important because you can get extremely sick if you come into contact with the meningitis bacteria. It&rsquo;s easily spread and can sneak up on you. I remember at one of the institutions that I lived at, one of the greatest people that I knew passed away due to contracting bacterial meningitis. He was a junior when he died, so he already had two years at the institution but had never had the meningococcal vaccination. Make sure that you are getting the proper vaccinations so that you can avoid these diseases or illnesses that you can contract being on college campuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know it sounds simple, but please wash your hands people! Shower daily and see your doctor for regular check-ups. I&rsquo;m not sure if every household teaches these things, but take it from me, these are simple, yet important tips. Some students are going to be far away from home while in college. Don&rsquo;t forget to find and visit both a local dentist and a primary health care provider. You should still be mindful of your health even though you&rsquo;re away from home. This is very important. Get check-ups and wellness checks. These are things that you should keep in mind when you&rsquo;re away at school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This chapter seems a bit scary and it doesn&#39;t appear to be as friendly or perky and optimistic as some of the other chapters, but death is real, it happens and it needs to be talked about. Death could realistically happen to any student, on any campus in the country. Death doesn&rsquo;t have any specific targets. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re a good person or a good student or not a good person; no one is exempt from death. I want to make sure that the students are equipped with the knowledge, skills and resources to make the best decisions possible so that avoidable deaths can be lessened on campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Death is not only hard for students, but it&#39;s also hard for the professionals who work with these students. We work with these students every single day to ensure that they&#39;re getting the utmost care and that they&#39;re having a great time. I&rsquo;m sure the students reading this can probably think of that one professional that made an impact in their lives, whether it was in high school or college. We create relationships with the students. We learn to care about them, love them, want the best for them, want to see them succeed and, ultimately, want them to live out their dreams. To have a student taken suddenly, is a really sobering experience that student affairs professionals go through as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why do I say all of this to you? Because a lot of students experience their first death in college. They know someone who dies in college or there is a death of a family member. A lot of students don&#39;t know how to deal with grief and grieving is different and difficult for everyone. Not everybody experiences grief the same way. In my experience, when you have a plan in place for extreme circumstances, like death and handling grief, it can only help. It&rsquo;s important for me, as the author, to allow myself to be vulnerable to you so that you know that I&rsquo;m coming from a place of honesty and realism. I never want to pretend that these tips and suggestions are so abstract that the reader can&rsquo;t truly hone in on what I&#39;m saying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me personally, when I first hear about a death and start experiencing the grieving, it&rsquo;s normally just a huge shock to me. I can&rsquo;t believe that the person is gone. I don&#39;t have any other feelings at that point, only shock. I&rsquo;m not sad. I&#39;m not mad. I&rsquo;m not upset. It&#39;s just shock. I guess you could say shock is normally <em>my </em>first state of grief. Remember that each person may go through the different stages of grief, at different times and that&rsquo;s okay. The process of grief is painful, but should be embraced. It&rsquo;s not something you can hide from. It takes time to go through the process, but give death the reverence it deserves. The next stage I typically go through is utter sadness. I start to cry or I start to feel pain, loneliness and sadness. Some people who experience grief feel the pain, loneliness and sadness immediately. They miss the shock emotion and instantly go straight into sorrow. Normally, my last stage of grief is acceptance. I&rsquo;m accepting that this loved one or this student is no longer here. I&rsquo;m accepting that I won&rsquo;t see them again. I&rsquo;m accepting that anything can change at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have to know how <em>you</em> handle grief. It&#39;s really important to figure out how you handle grief, before grief happens. There is no way to properly prepare for it, but knowing that these stages will probably occur, can be helpful. Grief looks different for many people and comes in many forms. Grief for a colleague may look different than grief for a parent or close friend. There are, however, seven stages of grief that most people go through and these stages can happen in any particular order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stage 1- Shock</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stage 2- Denial</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stage 3- Anger</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stage 4-Bargaining</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stage 5-Depression</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stage 6-Testing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stage 7-Acceptance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;When it comes to death, my advice to both parents and students is the same. I think that these tips could be helpful to anyone. First, be open about death and grief. To pretend that death doesn&#39;t exist, in real life or on college campuses, is ignorant. Pretending would be setting yourself up for a major disappointment. Have open conversations about death. Know that death can happen. Know that death will happen. Some deaths can be prevented, but some of them can&rsquo;t. I think sometimes, even when we talk about death, we pretend that young people are exempt from dying because they&#39;re young, that only old people die and we all know that&rsquo;s just not true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to talk realistically about what happens when we have individuals in our family who are sick. Think about it, if you are a college student and a close family member is sick, do you really want to go to a school that&rsquo;s really far away? If you know that you want to be closer to your family and that these are hard times for your family, realistically you may want to go to a school that&rsquo;s a little closer to your family in the event that something happens and you need to get home quickly. I think that what&#39;s most important is not to hide from it. Don&rsquo;t hide that it could happen, that it did happen or how we feel about it happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s also vital is the need to focus on what&#39;s important to us. What&rsquo;s important is our family, friends, and getting a degree from an institution of higher education. We can&#39;t lose that focus due to death or other situations that are out of our control. We need to lean on others. I know that while campus deaths are sad events (that we never want to see happen), when death has occurred, I have never seen a more unified campus than during that initial time of grief. That&rsquo;s the time when I see students truly coming together. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s due to a very sad circumstance, but the togetherness that occurs is awesome. Normally, individuals who live within our campus communities make such a great impact that when they die, it triggers the campus to come together and create unity. There is almost an unspoken power when people are grieving together. We need to make sure we&rsquo;re bringing everybody together, not just when a campus crisis such as death happens. We should be embracing our togetherness all the time.</p>', '2020-09-07 23:21:24', '2020-09-11 00:02:01', NULL),
(31, 6, 'Bling-Bling, Money Is A Thing', NULL, 20, '<p>Cha-ching! If you like that sound, like most Americans do, then that means that you like money. If you can pull your purse or wallet out right now and you have a credit card or some cash in there, then this chapter is definitely for you! For colleges and institutions around the country, sometimes that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about. <em>Show me the money, baby!</em> <em>It&rsquo;s all about the Benjamins! Bling-bling, money ain&rsquo;t a thing!</em> It seems that there are some college students who have more than enough money, but there are others, like me when I was in school, who don&rsquo;t have an extra $5 to their name!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was in college, back in 2010, I drove a 2000 Chevy Malibu. It had over 100,000 miles on it, but it got me to and from where I needed to go. I had a friend who drove a 2011 Corvette! He, or rather his family, had a lot of money. On spring break, I went home and hung out with my family and I worked. Other students, went to France or overseas or to the islands for their spring break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The financial situation will vary for each student. For the readers (both students and parents), if you don&rsquo;t have $40,000 in your pocket right now to pay for school this year, you&rsquo;ll find some great tips in this chapter. The majority of us don&rsquo;t have $40,000, sitting around, at our disposal. If we did, college loan debt wouldn&rsquo;t be so monumental. Due to the amount of people attending college, educational loan debt has now surpassed national credit card debt. College students don&rsquo;t have much of a choice; loans are how you achieve obtaining a higher education. You will probably be paying back these loans for the rest of your lives. In fact, your children and maybe even your grandchildren may be paying back your school loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s an elephant in the room and we need to talk about it...DEBT! For the majority of you, you will have some form of debt for your <em>entire </em>life; whether it&rsquo;s student loans, credit cards, a car loan or a mortgage. Generally, credit cards are how a good amount of Americans survive. For the students reading this, you&rsquo;re probably going to be in debt for a long while. For the parents, if you&rsquo;re co-signing for your kid&rsquo;s loans or maybe even still paying off your own college debt, well, that&rsquo;s life; it&rsquo;s basically the norm. Everyone is going to have debt! When it comes to a college education, there are different types of debt. There are the people who only have a small amount of loan debt and then the people who have a ton of loan debt from school. It really depends on which route you take to gain financial strength during your college years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your move-in day experience, on college campus, is similar to what mine was, this is what might happen. You move in and you&rsquo;re greeted by a variety of credit card companies that are strategically placed throughout the campus. The offers may say something like, &ldquo;Sign up with us because we&#39;ll give you the best interest rate!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Make sure that your child always has access to funds...in case of emergency. Apply for a credit card with us now!&rdquo; Believe it or not, I did not open one credit card throughout college. What?! I know, that&rsquo;s crazy! I just didn&rsquo;t feel it would be a good idea for <em>me.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some benefits and a few setbacks of <em>not</em> opening up a credit card account. I knew that I could not be trusted having a credit card, so I didn&#39;t open one. I knew that if I had &ldquo;free money&rdquo; (we&rsquo;ll get back to &ldquo;free money&rdquo; in a second) I might needlessly spend. There&rsquo;s no accountability when &ldquo;free money&rdquo; is involved until the bill comes in. If you know you&rsquo;re like this or parents, if you know your child can&rsquo;t be trusted with &ldquo;free money&rdquo;, do not open a credit card; not a good move! With a credit card comes a responsibility. Let&rsquo;s make sure we are guiding the students towards being responsible, especially when they have this &ldquo;free money&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking back and knowing what I know now, I wish I had taken advantage of one of the many credit card offers presented to me. If you&rsquo;re responsible with money or parents, if you know your child can manage having a credit card, do it! This will help them on the road to building credit.&nbsp; Think about it, when you graduate from college, you&#39;re most likely going to want to get an apartment or get a new car, but these things require you to have credit. If you take advantage of the offers, early on, you&rsquo;ll have had four years of good credit at graduation, which is great! I wish I had built credit when I was an undergrad student because as soon as I graduated, I needed credit for so many different situations, but I didn&rsquo;t have enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to the term &ldquo;free money&rdquo;. We all know there&rsquo;s no such thing, right?! Any borrowed money will eventually have to be paid back, with interest. This means that we need to be fiscally and financially responsible every time we swipe that card. For the students that I see pulling out their credit card at a convenience store for a pack of gum, this is not a smart idea. If you&#39;re going to swipe that credit card, at least swipe it for something you absolutely need, not a pack of gum! If you&rsquo;re going to use the card for trivial purchases, like a pack of gum, make sure you pay off the balance every month; at least you&rsquo;ll be building your credit. Swiping that card, multiple times a day, is not the answer. Sometimes you&rsquo;re going to have to do without. Sometimes you have to buy something that costs less. Sometimes purchasing name brand clothes isn&#39;t the best choice. Maybe going on that vacation over spring break isn&#39;t necessary. It&#39;s okay to get used books and it&rsquo;s also okay to rent your books. You don&#39;t have to live in the most expensive residence hall, maybe you live off-campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another point I&rsquo;d like to make is that you don&#39;t need to have three, four or five different credit cards! All of those cards and actions are connected to your credit score. At this point in your life, the goal of having a credit card or open line of credit, is to build your credit score so you have the opportunity to build your future. If you&rsquo;re already having trouble affording college and affording life in general, creating extensive debt is not going to help you build a successful future.&nbsp; It seems that nowadays students are coming out of college with not only student loan debt, but credit card debt too. Sometimes those debts are almost equal. You knew going into college that you would have regular college loan debt, but now you&rsquo;re coming out with loan debt and credit card debt!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be certain that you are fully aware and knowledgeable about any credit cards or discount programs that you have signed up for. The credit card companies have a lot of enticing gimmicks out there. Here&rsquo;s an example: &ldquo;Open a credit card with us and we&rsquo;ll give you $100 gift card that you can use anywhere on campus.&rdquo; That sounds like a pretty good deal, right? What about the credit card company that says, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give you huge discounts on local purchases and we&rsquo;ll give you back a percentage for every swipe that you do on campus.&rdquo; Yeah, yeah, yeah. Again, it sounds great, but if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Ultimately, where do these actions leave you in 3-5 years? Will you be paying more money or less money? Remember credit cards require you to pay interest if you don&rsquo;t pay them off each month. Is having a credit card or open line of credit beneficial for you? These are all questions you need to ask yourself <em>before </em>opening up a credit card. I realize that when you don&rsquo;t have access to much money, opening a credit card can feel like a valuable option for your situation, but that&rsquo;s not necessarily always the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure out the best way for you to financially make ends meet. This can only happen when you make a financial plan. It&#39;s essential that we teach students to live within their means and that starts with us showing them how to accomplish that. I realize this can be difficult, even for some adults. If we&#39;re telling the students, &ldquo;Make sure you set up a budget and that you&rsquo;re spending realistically.&rdquo; but then we&rsquo;re not living that same way, what lesson does that teach? Let&rsquo;s show and teach the students that we want them to come out of college with a reasonable amount of good credit, as minimal debt as possible and a world of opportunities ahead of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&#39;t have a budget set up, right now, you need to create one. You should know how much you&rsquo;re spending each month versus the income you&rsquo;re bringing in each month. If you&#39;re reading this chapter right now and you do not have a savings account, just stop everything you&rsquo;re doing and go open a savings account, immediately! I wish someone had told me to put away $10 each week, for my entire four years of college, but no one told me. When you get out of college, the first thing you&#39;re going to want and need, is money. I&rsquo;m telling you, students and parents, if you want to give yourself the best college gift possible, give yourself some savings. If you put $10 away per week for four years, imagine the amount of money you would have saved!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s another way to think about it. If you have money to buy alcohol, then you definitely have $10 to put away in a savings account each week. If you have money to go and buy new clothes, then you&rsquo;ve got $10 to put in your savings account. If you have money to go out to a restaurant for a meal (even if the appetizers are half price!), then you have $10 to put in your savings account. Maybe you can skip going out with your friends, or skip a night at the bar, or whatever you&rsquo;re spending $10 on each week. Put that $10 a week into a savings account. In four years, you will have $360 per yr x 4 years = $1440. I know it doesn&rsquo;t sound like a lot, but its way more than nothing! Give yourself this gift. When you get out of college, the first thing you need is a job. You may need a place to live. You might need a car. You&rsquo;re going to need some cash flow. We already talked about all the debt you can incur while in college, so do yourself a favor and gift yourself a savings account that can help your immediate future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be cautious and mindful of your spending habits. Our spending habits can easily take on a pattern. When I look at my spending habits, especially from when I was in college, the biggest expense was food; and I ate a lot! That is where all of my college money went. I had chosen a bank that provided quarterly meetings with me; to make sure that I was doing the best I could to save money. I remember the banker sitting down with me and saying, &ldquo;You really like to eat, don&#39;t you?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Well, I think everybody likes to eat.&rdquo; He looked at me sincerely and said, &ldquo;No! You really like to eat!&rdquo; He showed me my spending habits and when he put it down on paper, I noticed that I was eating out a lot. Remember I told you in a previous chapter that, as a resident assistant, I had a meal plan. Why would I be going out and eating all this food, when I already had food that was paid for?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My loose spending habits were not benefiting me if I was also trying to save money. So, I made a budget. I decided that I would allot myself a certain amount for outside-of-my-meal-plan food consumption. Instead of going out to eat 3-4 times per week, I adjusted my spending and only indulged 3-4 times per month. Once I made this change, my extra food spending went from approximately $200 per month to about $60 per month. Just by making that one change, I was able to save an additional $120 per month. Do a self-audit. Go through your finances and see what you&rsquo;re really spending money on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It bothers me when students become another statistic. I think about all the students who spend a ton of money, incur even more debt than imaginable and then have to drop out prior to graduating. They become a statistic. An alarming 38% of students encounter financial hardship sometime during their college years. This hardship may result in the student dropping out or having to transfer to a community college. Something like 7% of students do not have the financial means to continue college after their first semester, so they have to drop out or transfer to a community college. Unfortunately, this is the sad truth, but proper planning, ahead of time, could alleviate some of this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this and thinking, &ldquo;Hey look, Justin. I don&#39;t have the money&rdquo; or &ldquo;Justin, I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m going to make ends meet.&rdquo; Let me share with you some of the alternative ways I created income while I was in college? When I was in college, living on campus, I had four jobs and I have no shame in sharing that with you. I worked in the admissions office. I gave tours and got paid per completed tour. I worked in the P.R. office (Since I was a public relations major, why not get the experience <em>and </em>get paid to do it?). I worked in orientation helping new students get acclimated to the institution. In the end, working in residence life, benefited me the most financially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about residence life throughout this book and in my previous book. I&rsquo;ve revealed how residence life really helped me with many aspects of my education, while I was attending school. I don&rsquo;t think I could have done it without them. That said, being a resident assistant is extremely challenging. There&rsquo;s not a ton of money in this occupation, but if you have a love for people, a servant&rsquo;s heart, the ability to want to encourage, strengthen and develop students, this is definitely the job for you. I was an R.A. for three years while I was at school. When you&rsquo;re an R.A., they typically pay for your room and board and also food. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s different at each school but I&rsquo;m positive there is a financial benefit to being an R.A, regardless of the school. Honestly, without assistance, I don&rsquo;t know if I would&rsquo;ve been able to afford going to school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I consider it a blessing that I was able to be a part of residence life and I think residence life is a blessing to so many people. That&rsquo;s why I&#39;m a strong advocate for residence life departments on college campuses. They do such good work and are often overlooked. Students definitely visit their R.A.&rsquo;s with issues, during the day, but at night, it&rsquo;s a whole &lsquo;nother ball game. The freaks come out at night! The people who work in residence life are equivalent to first responders when in comes to on-campus issues. We&rsquo;re the ones handling the heavy load. Handling the students&rsquo; issues, on a daily basis, can be exhausting. That said, students, if you&#39;re looking for some type of financial help while you&rsquo;re in school, check out the leadership roles in residence life. Just to let you know, they don&#39;t accept every applicant for resident assistant or community assistant. They&rsquo;re going to want to know what life skills you can bring to the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a resident or community assistant, you&rsquo;ll be on duty within the halls. You&rsquo;re responsible for ensuring that the residence hall is well taken care of and everything is running smoothly. Unfortunately, there is this bogus notion that when you are resident assistant, you are a snitch; that you report students who are drinking;. That&rsquo;s a myth and not true. I tell my R.A.&rsquo;s, &ldquo;You are only a reporter. If you see something happening that shouldn&rsquo;t be, report it. If nothing news-worthy is happening, then there&rsquo;s nothing to report.&rdquo; We are attempting to create a better culture, keep everyone safe and we&rsquo;re trying to instill values of working hard <em>and</em> having fun. Working hard means you&rsquo;ll eventually get a return on your investment. Invest in yourself!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students, there are plenty of jobs on campus! The on-campus jobs are convenient and plentiful. There are jobs as a tutor, in the dining hall, in campus recreation or even a student employee in a variety of departments on campus. The journey for one of these jobs starts before you even get to your college campus; research the jobs and apply early.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously money is important during college and because it&rsquo;s important to live, sometimes students participate in illegal or less than astute activities, in order to make ends meet. We talked in a previous chapter about a girl who didn&#39;t have enough money to pay for school so she ended up becoming a drug dealer to make money. Please don&rsquo;t sell drugs to make your tuition payment; there are other ways to make money. Some students donate blood or plasma. Not the healthiest choice, but thankfully, there are rules set in place to make sure you&rsquo;re not hurting yourself and at least you&rsquo;re helping someone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some students even go as far as being &ldquo;sugar babies&rdquo;. If you&rsquo;re unsure of what this term means, you may want to look it up. I realize that this isn&rsquo;t something people want to talk about, but this is a real thing! There are tons of documentaries and articles available on this topic. I actually had a friend who was a sugar baby. She wasn&rsquo;t engaging in sexual acts with the man who helped her financially; she would just spend time with him, and keep him company. She went on trips and attended fancy events with him. In the end, he basically paid for her entire schooling. He also bought her a Mercedes Benz. It made me think, what was I doing? Could I be a sugar baby? Are men sugar babies? They sure are! How do we go about doing this? I&#39;m just joking, but at the same time, that situation worked out for her and there&#39;s no judgment here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know some students who were strippers during college; both male and female. There is nothing illegal about being a stripper, but before venturing into this occupation to make money, exhaust all other options. Know going into this that there may be some negative backlash and consequences to being a stripper. Your reputation may also be affected and I need to mention that there is risk involved in this type of job. Risk with the people you will be around, the environment and the customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m fairly certain that you can&rsquo;t add sugar baby or stripper to your resume, but by all means, do what you&#39;ve got to do so that you can make ends meet. Does this mean I&rsquo;m advocating for being a sugar baby or a stripper? No, but I also get that students will need to make money to make ends meet and stay in college. What I <em>am</em> advocating for is that students only acquire jobs that will not result in them going to jail. This means no selling drugs or robbing houses!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever you decide to do for additional income, make sure that you are being a good steward of your money? The first thing you can do is to be realistic about the institutions you choose to attend. When I first started researching colleges, I was looking at the biggest and best names in the college biz and not paying any mind to the cost on my pockets. Sure, these schools I was looking into were great schools, if I could even get into them, but where was I going to get $45,000 a year? You already know I didn&rsquo;t have that kind of money. Even with the four jobs I had at the institution, I still wouldn&rsquo;t have made $45,000 a year. I started looking at smaller schools, not necessarily D1 schools, but more in the D2 or D3 range. (The difference between D1, D2 and D3 colleges has to do with the number of sports programs they promote and the caliber of athletes that participate in those sports.) I ultimately settled on a D2 school where it would cost me anywhere between $22,000-$30,000 a year. This was a much more financially responsible choice for me and for my pockets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to help your financial situation is to apply for as many scholarships and grants as possible. Listen to me, there are so many different scholarships and grants available, it&#39;s ridiculous. There are scholarships and grants for just about any circumstance you can think of. For example: If you create your entire prom dress out of duct tape, there&rsquo;s a scholarship for you! There is, literally, a scholarship or grant for everyone. There are scholarships and grants that aren&rsquo;t even being distributed because no one is applying for them. For example: Look at the D.A.P program; The Diversity Awareness Program. I created a $200 scholarship to give away. I know that&rsquo;s not a lot, but this is just the start to the newly founded scholarship program, which began in 2017. Again, not a lot, but that $200 will take care of a book or maybe two books or maybe help with someone&rsquo;s tuition. I advertised everywhere. The scholarship was up for grabs for two months and not one person applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got a lot of these types of scholarships when I went to school solely because no one else applied. Shoot, I was applying for college scholarships that I knew I didn&#39;t even qualify for and because there were no other applicants, I got the scholarships by default. That actually happened to me 3-4 different times. Apply for scholarships! If you have time to be on the Gram, sliding in people&rsquo;s DM&rsquo;s, or be on Facebook, you definitely have time to apply for some scholarship money. It&rsquo;s free money! That&#39;s the only type of money that&#39;s free: grants and scholarship money! Take advantage of the ones that are available to you and use them for your benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In college, there are many components that will require you to spend money: tuition, a place to live (on or off campus), possible commuting costs, books, food, a gym membership, club/organization membership fees, and so much more. College is more expensive now than it has ever been. This is a fact; doesn&rsquo;t matter which part of the world you&rsquo;re from. The cost of tuition and books has increased exponentially in the past 20 years. The cost of living is greater and college-incurred debt is at an all time high. Make sure you&rsquo;re spending money appropriately, making wise decisions when it comes to your credit and putting a little away in a savings account for your future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tips and reminders for students:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t spend money on dumb stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open a savings account and put $10 in it, every week!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t do anything illegal to make extra money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get a job while in high school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apply for jobs and do it early.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apply for grants and scholarships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open one credit card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tips and reminders for parents:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Create a college savings plan for your child as soon as they&rsquo;re born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instill healthy financial savings habits in your kids&hellip;.early in life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Help them create a savings plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it&rsquo;s feasible, save money for their education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Encourage them to get a part time job on campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Show them how to be financially responsible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As always, with all of the topics in this book, open and honest dialogue and conversation is a must. Money can be tricky but there&rsquo;s a science to it. Learn the science and you&rsquo;ll be successful.</p>', '2020-09-07 23:21:44', '2020-09-11 00:02:06', NULL);

(32, 6, 'Freshman 20', NULL, 20, '<p>I know a lot of you reading this book probably love food and I am no different. I am definitely a foodie! I love food! When I got to college, I struggled with eating well-balanced meals. When you&rsquo;re in college, you can literally have pizza, cheeseburgers and chicken patties every day. I know a lot of people who go to college also eat ramen noodles and things like that on a daily basis. You&rsquo;ll hear a lot of people say, watch out for the freshman fifteen. Now a days, the freshman 15, has without a doubt, become the freshman 20!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s hard because in college there aren&rsquo;t too many choices when it comes to food options. There&rsquo;s the dining hall, there&rsquo;s off-campus eating and then of course, fast food. I know for a lot of people who are eating the trending gluten-free or vegetarian options, this can be an additional challenge. However, if you live in a city, these places and these food options are plentiful. If you&rsquo;re on a college campus, not located in the city, those types of food are really hard to find and get to. If you&#39;re at a college campus and you need a special diet, you probably have to see the campus nutritionist to figure out how to accomplish this. And yes, campuses across the country do have campus nutritionists. If you need someone to help with a specialized diet, definitely inquire at your local dining hall. Food allergies are a real thing and people&#39;s diets are constantly shifting, changing and developing. Perhaps...Most campuses are trying to change and evolve with the changing food and dietary restrictions to include options such as sugar free, gluten free, dairy free, and trans fat free. All those things are really important, especially to the people affected by a food allergy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a college student, you&rsquo;ll need to figure out what&#39;s going to be more advantageous for your wallet: eating on-campus or off-campus. If you&rsquo;re a first year student, for the most part, you will probably be eating in your dining hall the most. You&rsquo;ve already paid for it and, sometimes, you&rsquo;ve overpaid for it, but it&rsquo;s paid for nonetheless. I&rsquo;m often mystified when students have a meal plan but they eat the majority of their food off-campus, as if they didn&#39;t pay for their food once already!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was an undergrad, I had a friend who paid for a meal plan but ate out every single day. Granted, he had the money to do that, but why pay for a meal plan if you&#39;re going to eat off-campus? Every day I would say, &ldquo;Hey. Let&rsquo;s go get something to eat.&rdquo; And every day, he would say, &ldquo;Yeah man. I&rsquo;m going to such-and-such, off-campus.&rdquo; I would say, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to the dining hall.&rdquo; He would always try and talk me into going to eat off-campus. Sometimes I would go with him, but I started to discover that the majority of the time he was eating off-campus, as if off-campus was the only option. I later figured out that he just didn&#39;t like the meal plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important discussion, between parents and their child, should include figuring out which meal plan fits best; both financially and nutritionally. An average meal plan consists of 14 meals per week, I would say that&rsquo;s a great plan; especially since most students are probably only going to eat two meals per day on-campus. Unless they have early classes, most students sleep in and probably miss breakfast, which means that they&#39;re going to need lunch and dinner. Or, let&rsquo;s say you do wake up early and you have breakfast and lunch on-campus, but then you decide to either go out for dinner or make your own food. The majority of upperclassmen students who live off campus do not use meal plans. However, if you are an upperclassman and you don&#39;t like to cook, a meal plan is definitely the way to go.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should absolutely be mindful of what you eat. I&#39;m telling you, when you come to campus, it&rsquo;s like a smorgasbord or a buffet; there are a lot of different foods to eat. The majority of the foods are &ldquo;fast food&rdquo; types of foods like: burgers, fries, pizza and chicken patties. Those are just some of the foods available; there are healthier options as well. Making sure you only eat those &ldquo;fast food&rdquo; types of food occasionally is necessary. Balance the junk food out with more nutritious foods. Just because you don&rsquo;t have mom and dad watching what you eat, doesn&rsquo;t mean that all of a sudden, you stop eating greens, aka &ndash; vegetables!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eating a well-balanced diet is really important, especially to your digestive system. I know that sounds gross but, a lot of students come to campus and aren&rsquo;t eating the foods their bodies are accustomed to and need. They get backed up and then they get sick! You also need to drink water and lots of it. Continue getting enough rest and eating well balanced meals. I say all of this because I have a friend who, in undergrad, when we first came to campus, he went wild with sweets! Growing up, his mom didn&rsquo;t let him eat sweets. We had a bakery on our campus and you could use your meal plan there. Well, let me tell you, my friend went crazy! He would get cakes; one time he got a whole cake! He would get cookies, ice cream, sherbet and cheesecake! He would just eat sweets, all the time. I guess he was making up for lost time. Most of the time, when I was sitting there eating a full meal, he was eating sweets. I didn&rsquo;t quite understand it, but to each their own. Over a short period of time, after arriving on campus, he developed really bad eating habits. His cholesterol level shot up and he got really sick. The moral of that story: Be mindful of what you&rsquo;re eating and how much you&rsquo;re eating!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you get to campus, the food is going to be different from the majority of foods you&rsquo;re accustomed to from back home. Consider how much you&#39;re eating, how quickly you&rsquo;re eating, how often you&rsquo;re eating and when you&#39;re eating. Think about it: new college schedules are completely different. Students aren&rsquo;t eating at 8 a.m., 12 p.m. and 6 p.m. Students may eat at 8 a.m., 2 p.m. and then not eat again until 2 a.m. Or, maybe they eat at 12 p.m. as their first meal and then not again until 1 a.m. There really aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;regular&rdquo; eating habits on campus. Students have crazy schedules, thus their eating schedules are equally as crazy! On most college campuses, you can eat as much as you want. Just because you can eat as much as you want doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you should.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statistics show that there has been an unusual increase in the last 10 years when it comes to eating disorders on college campuses. Increased stress and the change of leaving home and living on a college campus can be attributed to this increase. Eating disorders don&rsquo;t discriminate and can develop in any gender or race. Bulimia can be defined as an eating disorder in which large quantities of food are consumed in a short period of time, resulting in feelings of shame or guilt. Those feelings can lead to self-induced vomiting, purging or fasting, in order to feel &ldquo;normal&rdquo; again. Another eating disorder is anorexia. Anorexia is defined as an emotional disorder characterized by an obsessive desire to lose weight by refusing to eat. Both of these disorders are harmful to a person&rsquo;s mind and body. These disorders are common in college-age students who are attempting to transition into a new way of life, new schedules and new eating habits. If you or anyone you know are experiencing traits from either of these disorders, please seek help at your campus counseling center. The lack of acceptance of such a severe disorder can morph itself into many other psychological and physical health problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, you may see some students that develop new workout habits because they&#39;re trying to maintain their weight with exercise. Sometimes people take working out way too far. They try to work out multiple times a day and for some, access to a gym may be new to them. We also find that some of our students are taking workout supplements or even using steroids to meet the needs of the goal they have in mind and what they want to achieve for their body. If this describes you, make sure you are using the right supplements. If you&#39;re not sure, ask someone. Visit your campus recreation center or talk to the campus nutritionist; either one you go to should be able to help you in making this type of decision. Obviously, steroids should be avoided at all cost. The effects can be devastating to your body and your mind; not to mention they are illegal in the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One psychological problem that comes to mind, whether there is an eating disorder present or not, is body image. Body image can directly affect your self-esteem. Having a healthy mind can result in feeling good about your image, no matter what it looks like. If you have an exercise regimen, do it to meet your physical <em>and </em>emotional needs and do it in the healthiest, safest and most natural way possible. Adopting a healthy physical fitness regimen can help you stay focused, relieve stress, decrease depression and it&rsquo;s good for your overall health. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what your level of expertise is when it comes to physical activity. I know it can be easy to get up, go to class, come back and stay in your room studying. In fact, a lot of students follow that routine. Being sedentary can cause your metabolism to slow down, making weight gain a definite outcome. Movement of any kind is better than no movement at all. Do cardio or strength training; stay active!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tips for parents:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important that when you&#39;re checking in with your son or daughter, don&#39;t just call them for two seconds to say &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and ask how classes are going. Ask your student about everything. Ask what they&#39;re doing in regard to their studying. Ask how they&rsquo;re sleeping. Ask about what they&rsquo;re eating and when. Ask if they&rsquo;re staying active. Ask them if their getting out of their room and moving! This is really important for their overall health and success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tips for students:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be mindful of what you eat, how much you eat and when you eat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a meal plan, use it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s okay to have a healthy balance of nutritious food and junk food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If stress is getting to you, seek help immediately. An eating disorder is life altering and can develop from triggers such as stress and change to your &ldquo;normal&rdquo; life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t compare yourself to others; love you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not happy with your weight or your physical appearance, make a healthy change. Take care of yourself. No one is going to be able to take care of you more than you can. Your parents can call and check up on you all they want, but if you&rsquo;re not being honest with them (or honest with yourself), ultimately your health care, self-care and self-worth can suffer. It&rsquo;s all dependent upon you! We all know that weight gain can affect your mood, progress in school, confidence and self-esteem. A healthy lifestyle, a healthy mind and a healthy heart lead to better choices and ultimately, a better college experience.</p>', '2020-09-07 23:21:59', '2020-09-11 00:01:53', NULL),
(33, 6, 'Let’s Get Involved', NULL, 20, '<p>Look, I&#39;m going to be honest with you, if you&#39;re only going to college so that you can get a degree, so that you can get a better job, or so that you can make more money, then you&#39;re wasting your time. Do you realize how many people get degrees and can&rsquo;t find a job in their field? Or how many people get degrees and are not making the amount of money they anticipated? Going to college is not <em>solely </em>about getting a piece of paper that says you&#39;re certified to do what you&#39;ve been trained for. Going to college also has to do with you finding out who you are; about you developing and growing into the person that you want to be. Think about it, if college is just about getting certified, why are there so many non-academic engagements to get involved in while you&rsquo;re in college? That&rsquo;s why I think this chapter is so important. I find it crazy that there are some students who go to college and they don&#39;t get involved in anything; they literally go to class and that&#39;s it. My point here is that if you only want to go to class and go home, you could do that at home...for free! Why pay all that money and live on a college campus if you&rsquo;re not going to be involved?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that every student needs to have the same experience I had; not at all. In fact, when I was in school, I was probably involved in too much. When people say that they were stretched way too thin, they were talking about the definition set by Justin Brown. When I was in school, I was involved in about ten different organizations; one of those organizations I was the president, founder and creator of. I told you in another chapter, when I was on campus, I had four jobs. Why was being involved so important to me? For me personally, being involved gave me a variety of skills to add to my resume. It gave me the ability to work on teams and really focus on developing into the person I wanted to be. Being involved gave me the opportunity to get the necessary outside experience that I needed, in order to be the person who I am today. College is not just about what&#39;s happening inside the classroom, it&#39;s also about the opportunities and experiences that are happening outside of the classroom. The outside of the classroom involvement complements what you&#39;re doing in the classroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re reading this and you&rsquo;re a first year student or a parent, I&rsquo;m not saying you have to be involved in everything. I know a lot of people who went to school who weren&rsquo;t involved in many outside the classroom experiences and they went on to have very successful lives. But, did they get the most out of their college experience? Think about it, do you go to a fast food restaurant, order a meal from the value menu and then only eat the fries; forgetting about the drink and the burger. I know that&rsquo;s not what I do, yet it seems that a lot people do just that when they go to college. If you just want to go to class and go home, you may want to consider commuting or online college; it&rsquo;ll save you a lot of money. If you&#39;re going to school and living on campus, make the most out of your experience. Learning and development may start inside the classroom, but it continues to take place outside of the classroom. Sure, your classroom experience is going to give you all the instruction that you need on particular subjects, but other meaningful skills, attributes and experiences come from your learnings outside of the classroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re like me and want to see and experience everything available, that&rsquo;s great! I used to tell people that I was a thief in high school and I was a thief in college. What I meant by saying that is, I made it my job to steal every single opportunity that was available and let me tell you, I was a master thief. Any time a scholarship came out, I applied. If a job opportunity became available, I filled out an application. If there was an option to be a part of a student group, I was there! Looking back, I&#39;m so glad that I took advantage of all the opportunities presented to me; I had a lot of great experiences. I will say to all those go-getters out there, spreading yourself too thin has consequences. You may have to sacrifice sleep, time with your friends, or time with your family. Sometimes you&rsquo;re not eating well or exercising enough, but most importantly, you&#39;re not taking care of yourself properly. Ensure that you&#39;re taking time for yourself and you&#39;re doing what you need to do so that you remain healthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As many groups as there are on student campuses, you can be involved in almost anything. In fact, most schools allow you to create your own groups. If you see something that&rsquo;s missing on campus that you want to be a part of, create it. That&rsquo;s how my diversity program got started. When I got to my college campus, I realized there weren&rsquo;t many groups formed with the mission of bringing people together and creating unity; that was something I had an interest in. I had an advisor who guided and advised me, and a few others, on what types of events to do with the group and the advisor made sure that we were setting the group up correctly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One element you don&rsquo;t want to miss, if you want to start a student group on campus, is finding a good advisor. Find someone who will hold you accountable and make sure that your group is following the missions, goals and rules in order to be a successful campus group. Most campuses are looking for extra groups and new groups. If there was something that you did in high school or something you wanted to do but couldn&rsquo;t do, rest assured, you can try it on a college campus. In fact, most ideas presented to the Student Government Association result in some free funding to help you accomplish the task. You&rsquo;re already paying the money for tuition, you might as well get the most out of it and if someone is offering free money, then I would definitely hop on that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friends that I graduated with that I remain in contact with have expressed their disappointment in not taking full advantage of their college experience. Not saying that their college experiences were bad, just that they wish they would have done more, outside the classroom, while they were in school. They regret not taking advantage of the many opportunities available. Some mentioned their envy when they saw what I had accomplished. College goes by so fast. I think the longest college year is your first year. You&#39;re still trying to figure out who you are. Probably for the first time, you&rsquo;re away from your parents, your town and everything that&rsquo;s familiar to you. I thought it was the longest year out of all of them. After your freshman year, it happens in the blip of a second; it goes by so quickly. Before you know it, you&#39;re a senior and you&rsquo;re graduating. College is the only time in your life that will ever be like this. The only time where you just wake up, go to class, maybe have a job, participate in student groups, eat when you want and basically have minimal responsibilities. After college, life happens and boy does it happen fast! When you graduate college, it&rsquo;s time to start adulting; time for a little bit more responsibility. Make the most out of your college years and experience all that your heart desires; it only happens once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time management is key! If you don&#39;t measure time right, you could really find yourself messed up. I could tell you a whole bunch of stories about how I don&#39;t think that my friends used their time correctly, which they didn&rsquo;t &ndash; hint, hint - those friends know who they are. For this discussion, I&#39;m going to pretty much talk about myself. I think it&#39;s important for you, as the reader, to know that even though I&rsquo;m being honest and sharing my knowledge in the form of this book, I don&#39;t know everything. Here&rsquo;s some honesty for you: I put a lot more time into my campus jobs and into my campus leadership positions than I ever did in my academics. I tell people this and they don&#39;t believe me. I can honestly tell you that I don&rsquo;t remember my sophomore year of college. People think that&#39;s crazy, but I&#39;m serious; I really don&#39;t remember. It was the first year I became an R.A., the first year I became an orientation ambassador, the first year I started working for the public relations office at my university, and I had recently created my diversity program. I put so much effort into everything outside of my academics that the only reason I know I had a sophomore year is because I can go into my computer and see that I actually did homework assignments that year. I don&#39;t remember going to class. I don&rsquo;t remember what classes I took. I don&rsquo;t remember any assignments or any group work that I did. To some of you that may sound funny, but really, it&rsquo;s just plain sad. Why don&rsquo;t I remember? I was stretched way too thin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a student, make sure you&#39;re taking care of yourself. Administration, faculty and staff look for students to accomplish tasks and assignments all the time. If you&#39;re someone who&#39;s always raising your hand to take on extra, trust me, they will use you to get the task accomplished. I know I said to take advantage of as many opportunities as possible, but you also have to be realistic. I also told you I don&rsquo;t remember my sophomore year because I took on too much. Looking back, I should&rsquo;ve done a tiny bit less. Just because an opportunity comes up, it doesn&#39;t mean <em>you </em>have to do it. In fact, whenever something popped up, I&#39;m pretty sure the student body didn&#39;t even attempt to sign up because they already knew &ldquo;Justin&#39;s going to sign up for that.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m trying to advocate both sides. I&#39;m advocating for you to be the best student that you can be, but I&#39;m also advocating that you are realistic in your goals and that you&#39;re taking time for yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parents, if you see that your son or daughter is not involved, don&rsquo;t harp on them. This is not the time to say things like, &ldquo;You need to get involved, we&rsquo;re not paying all this money so you can just sit around after class &ndash; blah blah blah!&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t need us telling them what to do; we can simply guide and advise them. If your son or daughter is one of those individuals who will probably only go to class and not much more, it&rsquo;s okay! It&#39;s actually very common for first year students to not get too involved; their world is changing. Give them time to get acclimated to their new surroundings. Let them work it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there are the students who are heavily involved in their first year. The data and studies show that if we can grab students in their first year, or even better yet, in their first week of college, it increases their ability to stay at the college and to complete their education. If students feel that they are owning their university, their campus culture and their experience, they&rsquo;ll want to stay. All we need to do as staff and parents is gently encourage students to get involved and give them ideas of what they can get involved with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If at first, you don&#39;t see a group you want to get involved in, keep looking. There are a lot of student groups that I was a part of as a first-year student that I didn&#39;t necessarily care for. I went to a couple of meetings and decided, &ldquo;Nope, not for me.&rdquo; I&#39;ve attended student groups and left the meeting thinking, &ldquo;What the heck? How is that even a group?&rdquo; I attended this one student group called, &ldquo;Larping&rdquo;. I only attended one time. Larping is live, action role play. The members dressed up like they belonged in kingdoms. They had these foam swords and they were trying to knock each other out. It only took one hit to the face, with one of those foam daggers, and I was out! I never showed up again! There may also be times when you get involved in a student group and invest a lot of time and then the group ends up not being what you wanted or thought it would be. Find activities that interest you. If you don&rsquo;t find a group or activity that interests you, create a new group. Honestly, like I said, I never thought when I went to college that I would be creating a diversity group, but it happened. Sometimes, you don&#39;t find groups; sometimes the group or the idea find you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re bold enough to start your own student group, it will definitely involve a good amount of your personal time. And, if you&rsquo;re like me, the group will become your brainchild. You will feel an almost abnormal attachment. When I was in college, I felt that leaving a legacy was important. I founded, developed and was the president of the groups I created; of course, I had the help and support of other students and our advisor. When I graduated, I left those groups in the hands of other people. When you create great things and other people take up your legacy, after you leave, it&#39;s so satisfying knowing that your legacy is going to continue on. It was important to me and I was proud of the accomplishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another topic we should discuss is: Greek life. Greek life is huge on college campuses. Why? Greek life contributes to student leadership, community service and philanthropy. They also make a significant contribution to the diversity of the student body. You may be reading this thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a part of Greek life and there is <em>nothing</em> like the bonds you form.&rdquo; Or maybe you&rsquo;re thinking, &ldquo;No, I had a bad experience with Greek life; I would never be a part of that.&rdquo; I had a very interesting experience pertaining to Greek life. When I first arrived on campus, I saw a lot of people trying to pledge fraternities. I can tell you this, pledging white fraternities and pledging black fraternities are two totally different things. if you don&rsquo;t know, you should probably look up the differences between the two .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember a member from one of the two historically black fraternities came up to me and said, &ldquo;Hey we want you to be a part of our fraternity.&rdquo; I went to the meetings and they told me what a great opportunity this would be for me. I was all over this opportunity! I wanted in! With anything major in life, if you&#39;re going to be a part of Greek life (sorority or fraternity), do your research. Honestly, up front, most of the groups appear to be great, and some of them are, but sometimes things aren&rsquo;t always what they seem. After doing a little bit of research and talking to a few people, I was on the fence; did I want to join or not? I remember one of the fraternity brothers came up to me and said, &ldquo;You know what? I think this fraternity would be a really good fit for you.&rdquo; I asked him why and he replied, &ldquo;I think it&#39;ll be good for you because I don&#39;t really see you out in the black community much. This would provide you with some much needed face-time.&rdquo; This statement not only rubbed me the wrong way; it rubbed me in the complete opposite direction of that fraternity. In fact, I think this fueled the fire for the reason why I got so involved on campus, and not with Greek life. If the way to show my &ldquo;blackness&rdquo; was to be a part of this fraternity, then I wanted no parts of it. No matter what, me and the guys in that fraternity will probably have the same struggles in life. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I was part of the fraternity or not. Now, I wanted to prove that I could do it without Greek life. I&rsquo;m sure others have experienced similar situations and they&rsquo;re able to accomplish the goals they set during their college career, without Greek life. Still others, will use Greek life as a launching pad in setting up their success on college campuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that a lot of fraternities and sororities get bad raps because of all the recent media reports regarding hazing and pledging. In my experience, every fraternity or sorority says they don&rsquo;t haze; they don&rsquo;t make people pledge. We know that&rsquo;s not true though. I do know a few people who have conveyed that they were <em>not</em> hazed during their pledging process. In my opinion, (and I feel it&rsquo;s about 90% true) hazing has gone underground. In recent years, there has been a lot of publicity around hazing events going very wrong, resulting in some new laws being created. The laws were set to make sure people don&rsquo;t get hurt or suffer from health issues (either mental or physical), due to what takes place during the pledging process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many different Greek groups. There are honors fraternities and sororities, academic honors fraternities and sororities, and sports fraternities and sororities. There are a lot of different groups you can join. In relation to Greek life, I can recall one crazy hazing situation that I witnessed. I remember one night me and my friend Terrece were walking into our residence hall. It was just a normal night. We saw some guy and he was blindfolded. He was getting picked up and dragged out of the residence hall. Terrece and I just sat there watching the whole thing. They threw the guy in the trunk of a car. They slammed the trunk door closed and all four of the brothers got in the car and they drove off. We never knew what happened to that guy. Looking back on it now, we probably should&rsquo;ve said something to someone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My friend Terrece and I went to school together and are best friends. We talked about our different fraternity situations. In his situation, he was told to come to a certain building, at a certain time for a meeting. He didn&#39;t know what the meeting was for but he was given the specific location and time of the meeting and it was implied he <em>should </em>be there. He showed up at the specified meeting location, at the requested time. He showed up to a dark room. The light was then shockingly turned on and he saw the whole room filled with a bunch of fraternity brothers. They all had paddles. They were loud and extremely aggressive in trying to sell him on the fraternity. I think their tactics really turned him off as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, do the research! Before joining, look up the history on any fraternity or sorority you&rsquo;re considering. Talk to other students on campus, about their experiences with Greek life at your college. Greek life may not even exist on your campus. There are campuses, across the country, that don&#39;t support Greek life and don&rsquo;t have it represented at their university. Consider your path, with information based off of the fraternities and sororities reputations. People will tell you what their reputations are. And listen, every fraternity and sorority has a reputation. Don&rsquo;t pledge a group just because your friend is pledging that group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about the cost factor of joining a fraternity or sorority. This is not a cheap endeavor. There are dues to pay each semester. The dues go towards trips, shirts and swag, events and parties and a lot of other related items. Don&rsquo;t choose Greek life because it&rsquo;s the popular choice. Choose it if it&rsquo;s something that interests you. Some of the groups may not have the same morals, values and beliefs that you&#39;re looking to surround yourself with. You might be signing up for a college experience you weren&rsquo;t looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greek life does has some great benefits. Obviously, there&rsquo;s the philanthropy aspect and who doesn&rsquo;t want to help others? Philanthropists do a good amount of service for the community they live in. There seems to be endless networking opportunities. Just because I chose not to go that route, don&rsquo;t discount it; that direction may work for you. Greek life gets a bad rap but for the most part, you see fraternities and sororities doing a lot of good work on campus. Bottom line, do your research and figure out exactly who and what these groups are and what they represent. Do what you want to do for you, not for anyone else!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, I want to talk about finding a mentor and becoming a mentee. Getting involved isn&rsquo;t only about you. It&rsquo;s also about making sure that you line yourself up with people that are going to help you succeed and in turn, you can do the same for someone else. While I was at my institution, I had plenty of mentors. Why do I feel so strongly about this topic? These mentors came up before me and they knew of potential pitfalls and obstacles. They helped me gain successes that I had no clue were even there. I would be amiss or a liar if I told you that I went through my entire college process by myself and I didn&rsquo;t need any help. I had individuals who were a huge part of my success. They helped me to succeed and helped me make the most out of my skills and situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make finding a mentor one of the first things that do when you come to a college campus. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll find that one mentor, and you&rsquo;ll know when you&rsquo;ve found that special person. That person is going to become someone you could never, ever forget. Those are the individuals that make a long lasting impact on your life. These are the individuals that you&#39;ll keep in touch with and call long after you graduate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had two of those people in my world; the director of public relations and one of the directors of admissions, both at Slippery Rock University. I still call and email with them today. We still check-in with each other; just to see how things are going and to catch up. I would not have become the man I am today without their leadership, guidance and support. You have to pay homage to those who took the time to help you. How do you pay homage? Do for someone else, what they did for you; become a mentor!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my first year of school, those people played a key part in me being successful. But when I became a junior and then a senior there were people who were coming up under me that needed the same help. Even though I was only a student, I could still help. I had some great experiences and had learned a lot and I could certainly share that information with someone else. I was able to use the skills I acquired from the people who mentored me. I paid it forward and became a mentor. I was actually a mentee and a mentor at the same time. I know a lot of you coming in from high school probably had mentors in high school; continue to utilize those people as well. They don&rsquo;t need to be on your campus to continue to provide knowledge, advice and wisdom. Keep those relationships open and valid. Those people can play key roles in your life as you will in someone else&rsquo;s life. Ultimately, what you get out of your college experience outside of the classroom will be dependent on your skills, drive and personality. Make your experience what you want it to be. Don&rsquo;t wait for others to get you out there, you get yourself out there. Get internships, job experience and tools to be as successful as you can. It&#39;s up to you.</p>', '2020-09-07 23:22:17', '2020-09-11 00:01:31', NULL);

(34, 6, 'My Final Thoughts', NULL, 20, '<p>Congratulations! You made it to the last chapter of the book! I like to offer my congratulations because sometimes people start books and they don&#39;t finish or they get into the middle of a book and it&#39;s really good and juicy, but then life interrupts. I&#39;m really happy that you took the time to read the book. I mentioned that this is my second book and I never thought I would write one book, let alone two. Sharing my knowledge and experiences with you has been such a blessing for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my previous book, I wrote a chapter on final thoughts. A lot of people contacted me and said that the final thoughts chapter was probably the most inspirational part of the book. I never want to end the conversation on, &lsquo;Things I didn&#39;t tell my mom in college&rsquo;. I think to end the conversation about college, student development, life&rsquo;s changes and overall well-being of students might allow people to think that these conversations can be ended, and they can&rsquo;t be ended; it&rsquo;s imperative we continue talking. These conversations can&rsquo;t end because we should be having these conversations on a regular basis; simply because the content is ever-changing, ever-fluid and ever-developing. As trends in higher education are changing, so are the students, the parents, the staff and society. In order to ensure that everyone is making the most of their college experiences and to ensure that we are hitting all the necessary topics and not missing anything important, we all should be changing right along with the trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So again I leave my final thoughts to you, my readers. I leave to you a compilation of all things Justin, words of wisdom, tips, tricks and everything I&#39;ve learned up to this point in my life to help you be as successful as possible during your college years. I don&rsquo;t confess to knowing everything; that would be completely untrue. But I do hope that you&#39;re able to take some of these life lessons and apply them to your lives and I hope that the information provided to you is beneficial to your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>College changed me. When I was in high school, I was that extremely happy and eccentric kid. I had endless energy and a lot of raw potential, but it was never really centralized, in one place, for me to focus on. College gave me the skills and abilities to figure out how to use everything that God had given me, to the best of my ability. That&rsquo;s what college is supposed to do. It&rsquo;s supposed to mold and shape you into the best person you can be. Allow this development to happen. Allow yourself to make the most out of your college experience. College is going to be a series of ups and downs, successes and failures; it&#39;s not going to be a perfect trip. I don&rsquo;t want this book to be presented as if college is this perfectly paved road with no potholes. You&rsquo;re definitely going to have some heartbreaks. You&rsquo;re going to have some setbacks. You&rsquo;re going to fail some tests. You&rsquo;re going to meet some people that hurt you and ultimately, you&rsquo;re going to have some days when you don&rsquo;t want to do any of it anymore. There were <em>many </em>times I wanted to drop out. There were times that I didn&#39;t want to <em>do</em> college anymore and there were plenty of times I just wanted to give up. But, as with anything else in life, you have to keep pushing forward. You have to keep taking all those experiences and let them mold you, shape you and develop you so you can become the best person possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you think there&rsquo;s a possibility that you&#39;re not going to do anything with your degree, don&#39;t go to college. Trust me, it would be a waste of your time and your money. You&rsquo;re only going to college so that you can be certified in something. A degree, after all, is just a piece of paper, people!&nbsp; But, it&rsquo;s the most expensive piece of paper you&rsquo;ll ever pay for! If you&rsquo;re going to do something with your degree, make sure that you&#39;re getting a degree in something that interests you; something you think you can do in your future. <em>You </em>have to choose your path and do it for yourself because being an adult is challenging and demanding, so you may as well enjoy what you do for a living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone once told me that being an adult is basically just emailing someone back and forth saying, &ldquo;Sorry for the delayed response!&rdquo; until one of you dies. Come on! For real? Life has got to be about more than that! Life should be a thrilling ride. A ride where you take a hold of the reins and have fun!&nbsp; Otherwise, you&rsquo;re wasting your time. It&rsquo;s inevitable, we&rsquo;re all going to die. You may as well take this time in your life and make it the best it can be. Life can be hard. Most people don&rsquo;t have it easy and most are not born with a silver spoon in their mouth. I figure if life is going to be hard and challenging, why not punch life right in the mouth with a fistful of success? Some of the best revenge you can have is success. With a show of hands, how many of you have had people that did you wrong, hurt you, turned their back on you or told you that you couldn&rsquo;t do something or wouldn&rsquo;t amount to anything? The best revenge is success. Go out there and knock life right in the mouth!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People are going to betray you; it happens. It&rsquo;s going to happen when you&rsquo;re in college too. This will happen in life after college as well. Don&rsquo;t hold onto those feelings of betrayal. Find something in the situation and create a learning experience. You&rsquo;ll also meet people in college who will end up being your best friends. You&rsquo;ll stay in contact way after you graduate. Keep the people that matter close, don&rsquo;t let those people go. I understand that life happens; people get married, have kids, get new jobs, and move away. Keep those valuable friendships intact so you can make a lifetime of memories with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look, no one is going to make you go to class; class is optional. You&#39;re paying your money to go to school and you&rsquo;re only going to go if you want to. I&#39;m saying that you have to take it seriously and if you&rsquo;re taking your college education seriously, you&rsquo;ll go to class. For some of you, you only get one shot and like I stated earlier in this text, you miss 100% of the shots you don&rsquo;t take. So step up to that line, dribble the ball and shoot for success! If you&#39;re not interested in going to class, you could&#39;ve stayed at home for free. Don&rsquo;t waste your time or your money; take it seriously. Show up and be present; physically, mentally and emotionally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Life usually doesn&#39;t provide you with chances. You need to create chances and take them! Go out there and get it! Live! No one is going to give you opportunities if you&#39;re not putting yourself in a place to receive those opportunities. Sign up for something new. Apply for things you wouldn&#39;t normally do. Do an internship. Do a practicum. Go out there and make new friends. Have lunch with someone you don&#39;t know. Get out there and experience different groups. Go see shows, go to a play. Do something new. You can find endless fun during your college years but you won&rsquo;t find it sitting in your dorm room. Get out there and make it happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will have failures and setbacks, but choose to fail forward, not backwards. Failures teach you valuable life lessons; they&rsquo;re an important factor in your continued learning. I think I learned the most valuable lessons during my college years, when I wasn&#39;t successful or when I had failed at something. I can&rsquo;t stress it enough, put yourself out there. Sometimes you need to bite the bullet and start caring about something new, with all your heart and energy. But you can&rsquo;t care about something if you continue to hold yourself back, anticipating the scenario not working out. Take the skills you learn from failures and apply them to every aspect of your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look, your parent&rsquo;s advice is wise, but it&#39;s not the end-all-be-all nor is it the only advice out there. Parents, I know that you&#39;re trying to guide your son or daughter the best way that you know how, using all the knowledge that you had about college and that&rsquo;s great, but the landscape has changed, drastically. If you&rsquo;ve read anything in this book, you&rsquo;ve probably realized, by now, that college is nothing like you remember. You can only advise your child the best way that you can. Your kids are not going to take every single piece of information that you give, and quite frankly, they shouldn&rsquo;t. They have to start making decisions for themselves. For the student, take the wisdom your parents are offering, add it to the morals and values they&rsquo;ve instilled in you, and create your own set of morals and values. That will help make you the successful person you want to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why stop at one degree? A lot of people go to college to get their undergraduate degree, bachelor&#39;s degree or associate&#39;s degree and then say, &ldquo;I&#39;m done, I&#39;m out, peace-out, sayonara.&rdquo; What I&rsquo;m saying is, if you really want to make the most out of any career or any situation, keep learning and keep moving forward. Keep getting certifications. Go get your master&rsquo;s degree. Move on and get your doctoral degree. Education can provide you with a variety of opportunities, so why stop with just one degree? Continue to push forward. Continue to broaden your mind. Continue to expand your knowledge. Continue to go through different trainings. Continue to learn and grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes in college you have to learn to stand alone. Not everybody is going to be on the same side as you. There are many times I had to take stances in college and I lost friends. There were times when I had to make important decisions; whether it was social injustice issues, dealing with group relations in team projects or just a run of the mill issue. Not everybody&#39;s going to have your back, so learn to stand alone. People can suck sometimes. No one said you have to be friends with everybody; choose your friends wisely. At most schools, there are thousands and thousands of students. It doesn&#39;t mean thousands and thousands of students are going to be your friends. In fact, you shouldn&rsquo;t <em>expect</em> anybody to be your friend. Everybody is running the same rat race as you are. Everybody&#39;s trying to earn a degree (or more) and be successful. Buckle down, keep your head up and be sure that you&#39;re doing what you need to do to be successful. Colleagues and friends will come and go along the way, regardless. Some people you meet in college will only be a part of your life for a season; others for a lifetime. Enjoy them either way and keep moving forward to your future successes!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want everybody who&#39;s reading this final chapter to know that you <em>have to</em> be better than the most recent generation. I know a lot of you are looking at the current generation and thinking, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doomed!&rdquo; There has to be someone out there who&rsquo;s going to change the entire facet of how the country runs or someone who really pushes us into the next era. We have got to be better than what was here before us. If not, we&rsquo;re all just going to fall down as fools. I know that sometimes when you&#39;re looking back at it all and thinking about what could have been, sometimes it sucks and it may seem hopeless. Students, if you spent this whole time thinking that you want to be a grown up, stop! Take the time you have now and really enjoy it! Think about it, a lot of people who are older look back and say, &ldquo;Man - I really wish I would have taken the time that I had when I was younger and made the most out of it.&rdquo; Don&#39;t be in such a rush to get older! It will happen; it&#39;s inevitable. So take the time now, do what you need to do, and enjoy it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t waste time while you&rsquo;re in school! We talked about school being such a short amount of time; for the majority of you it will be four years, some of you - five years. Don&#39;t waste the time that you have there, it&#39;s important to make the most of it. Unfortunately, there may be some events that happen to you while you&#39;re in college, like the death of a loved one, lack of money, or lack of motivation, but no matter what happens, don&rsquo;t let those obstacles hold you back. Keep moving forward. Go for what <em>you </em>want and not for what your parents want for you. Stay true to yourself and allow yourself to grow and to be challenged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&#39;re going to college, regardless of if you&rsquo;re joining a student group, choosing a major, or whatever, do something you love! Don&#39;t base your choices solely on what your parents are telling you or, for that matter, what other people are saying you should do. If you choose something that you love, you&rsquo;ll never work a day in your life. That means that you have to be smart when choosing a major and also be smart when you&rsquo;re planning financially for school. Do the research to make sure that you&#39;re choosing the best school, as well as making sure that the school is financially available to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have to tell you, I met a lot of moronic people in college. College is not just made up of the best minds in the entire world, trust me. Going to school does not measure your level of intelligence. Some of the most simple-minded people I&#39;ve met, I met in college. I can also tell you that some of the wisest people I&rsquo;ve ever met were blue collar workers who never stepped foot on a college campus. Having a degree does not categorize you as smart! It doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;ve arrived or that you&#39;re better than anybody else. I&rsquo;ve seen people flaunting their degrees as if they&#39;ve made it. College isn&rsquo;t for everybody. I am not advocating that every single person should go to college. A lot of successful people became successful without college and have made it without gaining a formalized degree; experience can be invaluable. If you choose to go to college and get a degree, it&#39;s your responsibility to go out there and change the world, create better policies, and make something new that the world hasn&#39;t seen. Don&#39;t continue to regurgitate the same mess that the world already sees every single day. We have to make the most of it and time goes by so quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be kind to everybody. You never know what&#39;s going on in someone&rsquo;s life. College students are dealing with a lot of things. If this book hasn&rsquo;t shown you that college has its own baggage, then I don&#39;t know what you were reading. You don&#39;t know what someone else is going through and you don&#39;t know the amount or type of baggage that they&rsquo;re carrying. Go out of your way, every day, and pay it forward; be kind. If we all practiced paying it forward, the world would be a much better place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students, you can do this by creating unforgettable moments and making unforgettable, life-long memories. You do this by putting yourself out there and embracing things that are new and uncomfortable. Make the most out of every situation and learn from your mistakes. Team up with people who are doing the same things as you and network with them; network your butt off! Meet new people who are going to open doors for you. College doesn&rsquo;t make you better than someone else, but it does give you more responsibility; the world is depending on you to be different. Love yourself, love your education, love your family and love what you do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parents, I know that you&#39;re trying to teach your kids some valuable lessons; trying to hone in on what they should expect when they go off to college. By all means - hammer away! If you don&#39;t, you&rsquo;re leaving it up to chance. You might be sending your child off to an institution and setting them up for failure. That&rsquo;s certainly not something any of us want. Not teaching your children and preparing them the best way you know how could result in your child going in the complete opposite direction of what you both had planned. Be realistic. Don&#39;t be in denial that your child may come home a changed young adult. I&rsquo;m sure throughout this book you&rsquo;ve probably thought, &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t happen to my child&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to tell my child about this.&rdquo; No! The purpose of this book is to help you have an open dialogue with your children, before, during and after they are in college, to ensure that they stay the course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s make sure we are ALL setting the students up for success. The best way to do this is by having that open dialogue and preparing them with all the knowledge that we can; the rest is up to them. The rest is on you, student! You have to take everything you&rsquo;ve been given and taught and put it into practice. Your parents have spent about 18 years trying to instill certain values, wisdom and knowledge in you that will, hopefully, help you to navigate this weird terrain known as college. Look, parents, you&#39;re not perfect and neither are your kids. Give your students room to grow and make mistakes. Just because they don&#39;t get something the first time doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&#39;re not going to get it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately students, the power is in you. I wrote this book because I wanted to give people hope. I also wanted to give people an inside look at some of the things that I see on a daily basis; some I experienced myself and some I witnessed firsthand. I know a lot of educators around the country probably see the exact same things. Students, it&#39;s up to you! You&#39;ve been given all the tools and skills that you need in order to be successful. We&rsquo;ve talked about all of the big topics that there are to talk about when it comes to entering higher education and we want you to make sure that you&#39;re making the best decisions possible. I look forward to seeing all of the wonderful things you create in this world and I know that you will be able to! It won&rsquo;t be because you read this book, but because the greatness is inside you: the greatness to be strong and the greatness to succeed and the greatness to do amazing things. What I know is that you&rsquo;ll be able to take what you&rsquo;ve learned and you&rsquo;ll be able to create greatness!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope you will refer back to this text if you ever need anything, because that&#39;s where I&#39;ll be. Whenever you need advice or wisdom about college, I&rsquo;ll be here; right in the words inside this book. If you&rsquo;re done with the book and you personally don&rsquo;t need it anymore, make sure you pass it on to somebody who&#39;s coming up behind you, because, like I said before, it&#39;s great to pay it forward. When you know better, you do better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peace!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justin L. Brown</p>', '2020-09-07 23:23:01', '2020-09-11 00:01:28', NULL);

(2, 10, '1', '<p>Welcome! So, you think that you were big and bad enough to pick up this book. Well, maybe it was because you saw the cover. Maybe it was because you have to read it for class, or just maybe you just thought this title was too interesting to pass up. Regardless of the reason, I&#39;m glad you picked it up because there&#39;s going to be some interesting topics that we will be talking about in this book. Speaking of interesting, I should&#39;ve known that I was going to have an interesting life. It wasn&rsquo;t from the fact that I had an opportunity to write a book, or from the fact that I received my master&#39;s degree. It wasn&rsquo;t even for the reason that I have met over 300 celebrities or because I have been to four different continents. It&rsquo;s definitely not because I have over 300 followers on Instagram (which is not that many) but seriously, maybe we should really look at how my life started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know it&#39;s the same old story, high school basketball star meets beautiful woman and the two fall in love. Then they become high school sweethearts, and boom here comes me. But actually, this story is very different because I decided that I wanted to be born on a highway! Yes, a highway! On the day of my birth, my parents were driving and my mom started having contractions. There wasn&#39;t enough time for her to get to the hospital. I decided I wanted to meet the world and there was nothing she could do about it. My mom and I were flown to the hospital in a helicopter and I made it just in time. Get it? JUST-IN time? Corny, huh?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want you, the reader, to know that I am just a normal guy. I love take-out just like you. I love Netflix (no chill)...let&#39;s just try Netflix and snacks. I love to sleep in and like you, I probably wish that Chick-fil-A was open on Sundays. I know there are people out there that wish Five-Below sold clothes, and like many of you, I love spending money on stuff that I don&#39;t need. I enjoy silly cat videos on YouTube, playing old Super Nintendo games, and eating Dunkaroos. I continue to watch Fresh Prince reruns and I think that <em>Batman, The Animated Series</em>, was the best cartoon of all time. But is there more to me? Well, my middle name is LaKyle. When I walked across the stage to get my master&rsquo;s degree they pronounced it Justin LACKEEL Brown. When I got back to my seat, my friend looked at me and said, &ldquo;LAKEEL? What&#39;s that?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;It&#39;s Hebrew, shhh!&rdquo; You see, every Black mother wants to give her child an interesting name. Most people call it &ldquo;ghetto,&rdquo; but some Black folk call it unique. Some parents go as far as to even name their children Uniqua. My mother said she didn&rsquo;t want that for me, so instead, she gave me a &ldquo;ghetto&rdquo; middle name. She claimed that if anybody ever asked what the &ldquo;L&rdquo; stood for when I became famous, just tell people that it stood for Lawrence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I find most interesting about all of this is that my mom owned and operated a child daycare center when I was growing up. The center was called Kim&#39;s Kreative Kids. As my youngest sister, who has a dark sense of humor, so cleverly points out, the acronym equals K.K.K. I think that was my first introduction to diversity. My mom had a very diverse day care of kids. There were about 15-20 kids from all different races. If you came to my parent&rsquo;s house, you would think that she had a small group of Planeteers from around the world. You might think that you were looking at the cast of <em>The Magic School Bus</em> or maybe you just thought that you stepped into <em>It&#39;s a Small World After All</em>. I really do think that was my first introduction to diversity because we had kids who were white, Asian, Black, Hispanic, and kids with disabilities. I never thought anything was wrong with this picture, it is just how life was. So when I would go and play with the kids, I didn&#39;t see any issues with color, ability, or ethnicity. Again, I was five. This time period of my life was right around the time that <em>Power Rangers</em> was a popular TV show. I know that every single time we played <em>Power Rangers</em>, they made me the Black Ranger. I didn&#39;t know why, but it happened. But even as kids, we just wanted to go and have some fun. There were no social constructs or rules. By the age of 3, 4, or even 5, you&#39;re not yet fully programmed to think a certain way. I didn&#39;t know that I was a Black kid or that my best friend was white and that my other best friend was Hispanic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#39;t think I realized I was Black until the sixth grade. I remember going to the mall; we have a few malls in the area where I grew up. We had the Exton Square Mall, which is just an average, local mall. Then we had the King of Prussia Mall, which is the second largest mall in the US. This story takes place at the Exton Square Mall. When I was in the sixth grade, probably about 10 years old, I remember stepping into a store called Suncoast. Special shout out to all those people who remember the store Suncoast &ndash; there were many stores like it such as Sam Goody or F Y E. Anyway, I remember it was wintertime and my mom always made me wear a heavy coat. It was pretty big and it wasn&rsquo;t fashionable. It wasn&#39;t made to be fashionable, it was made to keep me warm. Of course my mom was the only mom making me wear one and made sure that it was buttoned all the way up before I left. I can hear her now, &ldquo;You got money to go to the doctor? No? Then I suggest you put on that coat then!&rdquo; Unfortunately, it was her rules. It was either follow her rules and get a ride to the mall, or you can stay at home and be on AIM messenger. For those who remember what AIM messenger, take a moment to know that you are very old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, as soon as I got to the mall, first thing I would do was take off the jacket. I would ball it up and put it under my arm. You know, I was trying to be cool with my friends. I didn&#39;t want to wrap it around my waist or wear it like a cape because that wasn&rsquo;t cool. I remember going into Suncoast and checking out all of the VHS tapes. As I was walking around, it felt like someone was following me. I wasn&#39;t really paying too much attention to it at the time. But when I was about to leave the store, I remember two people being at the front. They looked directly at me and said, &ldquo;Sir where are you going?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&#39;m leaving&rdquo; and they said, &ldquo;We need you to come here with us.&rdquo;&nbsp; I went to where they asked me to and I remember the manager sitting there and he told me &ldquo;Shake out your coat.&rdquo; At the time, I didn&#39;t know I was being racially profiled. I actually didn&#39;t know why he asked me to do that. So I shook out my coat and he said, &ldquo;Oh I&#39;m sorry.&rdquo; But in my mind, I was like, shake out my coat for what? The manager didn&#39;t say anything else; he just walked away and I left. I remember coming home and telling my mom that story and how furious and angry she was. That was the first time I actually realized that racial tensions and racial barriers were a real thing and that I had been racially profiled. That was the first time I became aware that I was Black.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I come from Coatesville, PA. For all of you who don&#39;t know where that is, we&rsquo;re famous for two things. We&rsquo;re famous for basketball star Rip &ldquo;Rip City&rdquo; Hamilton and the steel that was manufactured at Luken&rsquo;s Steel Coatesville. Some of the steel was actually used for the Twin Towers at the World Trade Center. But most importantly, we&#39;re a big sports town. A lot of people comment, &ldquo;Oh, Coatesville &ndash; you guys destroyed us in basketball or you destroyed us in football.&rdquo; Then, other people don&#39;t know us at all so they say, Coatesville, you make coats there; it&#39;s actually not a funny joke. In Coatesville, everybody co-exists. I mean white people, Hispanic people, Black people, Asian people, gay people &ndash; they all live together. It&#39;s almost a reflection of how my mom&#39;s daycare was when I was growing up. So again, I didn&#39;t think anything was different. I didn&#39;t think I was being introduced to diversity because this is what I remember. It&#39;s a small city, at the bottom part of Southeast Pennsylvania about maybe fifty minutes outside Philadelphia. You see people from all different walks of life, people from diverse backgrounds, religions, ethnicities, different sexual orientation, origins, and cultural backgrounds. None of these differences seemed like a big deal to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I never thought that writing a book was going to be something that I would ever do. I had a high school teacher, (who would probably kill me if he knew that I was telling this story) Mr. Morton, who always told us that we should be better than what we think we are. I remember whenever I would turn in my essays in class, I always told him, &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m not a good writer.&rdquo; He would reply, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as good as you think you are.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve followed up with him later on in my life but I&#39;ll always just remember the things that he left us with in high school. One of the biggest stories that Mr. Morton taught us was the day that he knew he was going to marry his wife. What happened was, his wife had been out of town for a little bit and her sister called him because she needed help with her plumbing. He asked her, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask your dad?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Because I know you will come over and help.&rdquo; Mr. Morton said he remembered going over to his wife&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s place and she was sitting there in her panties at the top of the steps. She said, &ldquo;I really need my pipes fixed; let&#39;s see if you can fix them.&rdquo; Mr. Morton said he ran out of that room as fast as he could. He said when he got outside of the apartment, everyone from his girlfriend&#39;s family was there. They were all sitting there clapping and they were so happy. He said he remembers exactly how his wife felt. She came up to him and said, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; She was crying and everyone said, &ldquo;Welcome to the family.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s when he knew he was going to marry her. On the last day of school, he asked the class what they thought the moral of the story was. I remember being the first person to raise my hand, as always, and I said, &ldquo;The moral of the story is to always do right by your girlfriend.&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Everybody else then started giving their answers and thoughts. Someone said, &ldquo;The moral of the story is to always do the right thing.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Someone else said, &ldquo;The moral of the story is be a man of your word.&rdquo; He still said &ldquo;No.&rdquo; As we were all walking out of the class, her said, &ldquo;The moral of the story is, never leave your condoms in your car. Have a great summer everyone!&rdquo; We all left the class puzzled. I was the last one out of the room and Mr. Morton pulled me aside and said, &ldquo;I want to let you know, that story didn&#39;t happen.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t believe it! So he explained, &ldquo;I just wanted to give you a funny plot twist because that&#39;s very much how life is. Life is like a funny plot twist.&rdquo; I remember telling Mr. Morton, &ldquo;Thank you so much for everything you did for me this year, you were a great teacher.&rdquo; He reminded me, &ldquo;Continue to be better than you are.&rdquo; He encouraged me to keep writing. Well, like Mr. Morton said, life is pretty much like a plot twist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my senior year, I was trying hard to find the perfect college for me; There are so many colleges out there. I had been accepted to about 30 different schools, none of which were giving me the money I really needed. And all those &ldquo;promises&rdquo; of scholarships for African-American men didn&rsquo;t seem like it was going to happen. One day, I stumbled upon this little university about an hour north of Pittsburgh, a little school called Slippery Rock University. Yes, you heard me right, Slippery Rock University. It&rsquo;s actually a real place, you should look it up. There are a lot of legends about Slippery Rock and how it got its name, but the one that they refer to the most is this: During the colonial times, there were soldiers who were being chased by the local Seneca Indians. At the time, the troops were wearing very large and heavy boots. They were able to cross the rivers and the creeks in the forest area where they were being chased. But, the Indians weren&rsquo;t wearing boots; they were wearing moccasins. The Indians slipped on the rocks &ndash; Slippery Rock. There&rsquo;s actually a famous battle that&rsquo;s reenacted every year. George Washington stayed at a cabin outside Slippery Rock &ndash; it&rsquo;s this whole big thing. At this point in my world, all I was exposed to was a very diverse community. And, being a PK (for those who don&#39;t know, that stands for a Preacher&#39;s kid), I was taught to treat everybody as you would want them to treat you. Everyone in my church was multicultural. Everyone in my community was multicultural. Everyone in the daycare and everyone in all the schools that I attended growing up were multicultural. I really didn&#39;t think that anything outside of this existed. But then I got to Slippery Rock and found out that I was the only pepper in the milk! At the time, in 2007, Slippery Rock diversity enrollment rate was at 6%. That means I rarely saw anyone who looked like me, not my professors, not my colleagues, not the student leaders, not anyone. It was pretty much just me. It taught me some really valuable lessons. It taught me that you&#39;re going to have to step out of your comfort zone to be a leader. You might not have all the leadership skills right now, but you&#39;re going to develop them. I learned a lot about my cultural identity during my four years there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to be a Psychology major. I found out a little bit about Freud during Psych, and I said, &ldquo;SIKE!&rdquo; I ended up finding out that Communications is where I wanted to be, not knowing yet that Communications was going to take me to somewhere great. I had two classes that really stuck out to me at Slippery Rock &ndash; Human Diversity and Intercultural Communications. I think it was through these two classes that I found a love for diversity. It wasn&#39;t just something I lived; it was something I wanted to strive for. After taking those classes, I decided that I needed to do something at Slippery Rock that was going to leave a legacy. Something that was going to be worthwhile, so I created a diversity program from the ground up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essentially, the program was designed to bring all the students together on campus for active and engaging conversations along with facilitated games and activities. I wanted to start a student group. I wanted it to be great. I wanted everybody to see me as more than just a Black man. I wanted them to see a strong individual who had a lot of drive and leadership. Since there was little diversity on campus, some of the conversations I was having with people on campus revolved around me being the first person of color (or colored person) they ever talked to. They wanted to know since I was from the Philadelphia area, did I have a gun? People asked if they could touch my hair and I said, &ldquo;Nah, we have a problem here.&rdquo; These awkward interactions were the genesis of this program. We started off in very small in a closet, but we grew and broke the fire code. We moved to the multi-purpose room, but we grew and broke the fire code. Then we moved to the biggest space on campus, the Alumni House, where we met every Tuesday at 7:00 pm. Our average weekly attendance was ninety students. That is ninety students who were attending a program outside their curriculum to talk about diversity, cultural awareness, and multiculturalism. There&rsquo;s something special about a student, who has little to no training regarding diversity, who is able to enact such a change. More importantly, the changes were happening outside of me and this program. I started seeing things change in the dining halls, in the classrooms, and in the residence halls. People were becoming integrated due to the lessons they were learning in this program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then came the day when someone contacted me and asked if I was the student who created the diversity programs at Slippery Rock University. I said, &ldquo;I sure am.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;We love that program. We want you to bring it to our institution.&rdquo; So I did! Then I got a call from another school and another school and another school. That&rsquo;s when I knew there was something about this diversity thing, something about supporting communities that embrace and celebrate differences. There was something about having a dialogue about diversity and striving for excellence, respect, and friendship that was driving this program. Little did I know, in my junior year I would travel to 15 different schools to develop different programs on college campuses. This was as a student, I didn&rsquo;t even have my bachelor&rsquo;s degree yet. What kind of expert was I? I certainly didn&#39;t see myself as an expert at the time. Sure, I had gotten a full ride to Slippery Rock University and was very active on campus. I then received a full ride to Indiana University of Pennsylvania for my masters. Well, my next step in life, getting into one of the top ten master&#39;s programs in the country helped me with this self-actualization. But at age 20, was I really an expert?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I entered a field called Student Affairs in Higher Education. The student affairs field is composed of all of the offices, departments, and services available to students that are outside of the academic realm or the academy at a college or university. I feel like a lot of the learning that happens with students happens outside of the classroom. If you go to school for just the classroom experience, you&#39;re missing out on a part of your college career. I learned a lot about myself through that master&#39;s program; it challenged me academically, it pushed me intellectually, and made me reach as far as I could. I learned a lot about diversity and I ended up coming out of the program with a fully developed company. So when I left Slippery Rock, I was able to leave Building Bridges there and I ended up writing my first training manual called Diversity Awareness Program. This is what actually turned into what the company is known as today; The Diversity Awareness Program (D.A.P). It was really special because at the time, my first year as a grad student, I had traveled to about 45 different schools just talking about diversity and bringing people together in unity to challenge stereotypes and change perceptions. Then the time came for me to really take this thing on the road. I paid extreme attention to what I wanted to do with this program and it really blossomed. It makes me think back to the quote &ldquo;We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.&rdquo; As I was growing up and started un-programming myself, I became aware that NOT ALL men are created equal. Even more, I thought, why did it have to be all men, why couldn&rsquo;t it be all women as well? What if you don&#39;t identify as a man or woman, what if you&rsquo;re gender non-binary or gender queer?&nbsp; None of these things made sense to me until I really started getting on the road with this program and hear from my audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program is very simple. D.A.P&rsquo;s mission is to promote diversity and cultural awareness in all aspects of life to students, faculty, and staff on a university campus. This is done through active and engaging discussions on social trends, issues, and ideas. D.A.P. serves as a resourceful tool and encouraging students and community members to seek opportunities to become more culturally aware and conscious. D.A.P. has educated staff, students, faculty, officers of the law, and Fortune 500 companies by inviting a diverse group of people together to participate in activities that not only help them in small groups, but also take those discussion topics out to the global community. Some could say, &ldquo;Justin, are you telling me that this program holds two hour sessions, and you&rsquo;re playing games, participating in activities, and building ice breakers?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s exactly what I&#39;m telling you! Why? In a two hour period, I can take a group of 80 strangers and make them closer than any family they have ever known. Why? I&rsquo;ve discovered that individuals like to be heard. Individuals like to have fun. Individuals like competition and individuals really like to open up. You are probably sitting there saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an individual and I don&#39;t like to open up.&rdquo; Seriously, think to yourself &ndash; sometimes don&#39;t you just want to be heard? Don&#39;t you want somebody to just feel you and understand what you&#39;re saying? Don&rsquo;t you want to say something one time and know that people get you and get your thoughts? Everybody wants to be cared about and everybody wants to know that they are special. That&rsquo;s what this program does.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to expand upon this program when I became a Resident Director. Being a Resident Director is extremely interesting. I live and work on campus. I oversee a building of 700 students. It is very fascinating! It is like being in a nature documentary. You get to observe students&rsquo; living habits, their eating habits, their bathing habits, and their mating habits. I even get to see some of their tribal rituals &ndash; meaning when their herd moves. Essentially, that&#39;s on a Thirsty Thursday when I see a group of 60 students all leaving the building at one time, at 11:00pm...with their backpacks on. I guess they are going to the library. You get to see their migration patterns. Being a Resident Director and living amongst the students was and is one of the most beneficial things that has ever happened to me. You get to see your student&rsquo;s development from the first day that they move in until they leave. The students that leave are so much different from when they first started. Needless to say, they gave me a lot of material for this program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re going to dive into this program throughout the book. I think it&#39;s really important to know that I am not an expert but I am persistently trying to fine-tune and improve my craft. I may have been doing this for the past 10 years but I promise you, I started out where some of you are now &ndash; learning about diversity, culture awareness, and multiculturalism. I say this because I don&rsquo;t think that anyone can be a total expert because no one knows it all! However, while you are reading this book, I want you to keep in mind that this is from the vantage point of someone who has visited over 400 schools, presented, and seen this program in nine different modules over 600 times. I have also read countless books about diversity, multiculturalism, social justice, macroaggression, and cultural awareness. I want you to know that I&#39;m speaking from the heart of someone who has learned, someone who has read, someone who has been taught, and someone who has experienced. I want to apologize in advance. Some things you learn about the differences of other people &ndash; the way that they think, live, and carry themselves &ndash; you will not be able to learn in a book. If you&#39;re somebody who has picked up this book for entertainment, you&#39;re in luck. If you&#39;re someone who has picked up this book so that you could learn something, you&#39;re in luck. If you&rsquo;re someone who picked up this book because you wanted to become more aware of your own differences, you&#39;re in luck. If you&rsquo;re someone who picked up this book because you&#39;re really trying to jump into the heart and mind of Justin LaKyle Brown, well, you&rsquo;re in luck as well. None of us are experts in diversity. This material is based off of the experiences that I have had, things that I have seen, and things that I&#39;ve read. So student affairs professionals, you won&rsquo;t find theories here or any of the theorist who guides our practices, this is not what this book is about. This book is about the adventures and life lessons learned by Justin LaKyle Brown. So, sit back, enjoy, and let&#39;s go on this journey together.</p>', '2020-05-29 13:24:51', '2020-05-29 13:24:51', NULL);

(3, 11, '2', '<p>Congratulations, you made it this far. I&rsquo;m guessing that if Chapter 1 didn&rsquo;t scare you off and you want to continue reading, hopefully you&#39;ll read to the end of this chapter. That&rsquo;s my goal. Considering that I&#39;ve never written a book before, I am quite excited and thrilled to share my experiences with you. So please forgive my enthusiasm if I seem to be all over the place. I think that this same sentiment reflects my life. Life is kind of like a game of this or that. I&rsquo;ll say this over and over; I&rsquo;ve done this program at about 400 different schools. I&rsquo;ve done these modules and activities on diversity more than 600 times. I find it interesting when I&rsquo;m traveling and people ask, &ldquo;Justin, how do you come up with these activities? Some of these things are really controversial. How do you get an idea and just go with it?&rdquo; The short answer is that sometimes ideas just come to me. I&#39;ve driven around western PA for a long time while going to school. When I&rsquo;m driving on the turnpike, I get bored, so I may come up with a particular game. For example, let me count how many Confederate flags I see on my way to my next event. On this particular day, I counted sixteen. I try to come up with games that are going to be thought provoking. I try to come up with games and activities that are going to get individuals speaking. Here&rsquo;s my thing, when I&#39;m presenting these programs, I don&#39;t want individuals to have an activity where they can possibly provide the close ended answers of yes or no. This is because the programs are never about me, they&#39;re always about the participants. I need to hear their soul and hear their mind. I need to hear their experiences. I need to hear about what they&#39;ve been programmed to think. These are the things I need to unravel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of most of my programs is to get students to learn and unlearn &ndash; to deprogram themselves so they can start looking and thinking through a wider lens. Throughout the book, I&rsquo;m going to talk about a lot of different themes and experiences. One of the most popular games we conduct is called <em>This or That</em>. Essentially, I give two topics to choose from and the participants have to go to this side or that side. Like most of my games, I like to throw in a monkey wrench. The monkey wrench in this game is, there is no middle; you must pick a side. You would think these instructions were simple, right? No, people start to get uncomfortable when you take their ability to have the middle ground. Most people like to stay neutral when it comes to decisions. No one likes to offend, no one likes to muddy the water, and no one wants people to judge them. My ability to take away their neutral zone, their Switzerland you might say, really invokes some feelings. I tell everybody, we&#39;re going to start off with very easy topics then the topics will get a little harder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me take you through an example of this activity and introduce you to the student&rsquo;s reactions. The first topic is <em>Cats or Dogs</em>. Some people go to the cat side, others go to the dog side. Normally, in almost every program I&rsquo;ve done, there are at least ten times more people on the dog side than on the cat side. I always go to the lesser side first. So in this instance, I go to the cat side to talk to the people. These cat people really love cats! I didn&rsquo;t know until I started doing this program that some people actually like animals more than they like people. For my cat lovers out there, you really love your cats. So, I talk to some of these people on the cat side and I hear things like, &ldquo;I love my cats.&rdquo; and &ldquo;My cats are so great.&rdquo; I say to them, &ldquo;Wait, timeout! Cats with an S?&rdquo; I hear the reply of, &ldquo;Yes, I have five cats.&rdquo; At this point, I give them the side-eye; no judgment thrown to anyone out there with five cats! They talk about cats being cuddly and how they love them. They talk about how the cats always look out for them and they don&#39;t hurt them like some people do. The dog people on the other side are saying, &ldquo;Dogs are great!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dogs are always happy to see you.&rdquo; They say, &ldquo;Dogs are loyal.&rdquo; Then the cat people start talking again, &ldquo;Cats are independent. They don&#39;t need you.&rdquo; Then the dog people counter, &ldquo;You can train dogs to do what you want or need&rdquo; or &ldquo;Have you ever seen a seeing-eye cat?&rdquo; This is where the spark happens. The spark ignites in a moment&#39;s time, and with it I am able to pull myself out of the situation. My goal as the facilitator is to get the sparks to fly, to get people having conversations without me &ndash; 80% them, 20% me. Then things continue to get just a little bit more interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We talk about texting or calling. Individuals who seem to have closer relationships like calling so they can hear the other person&rsquo;s voice and inflection. While people who like texting are usually more direct and to the point. Their thought is, look, I just need to tell you what&#39;s on my mind or get this information out there. Texting gives me time to figure out what I need and how to say it. If we text, I have the ability to not text you back if I want, or to reflect more before I reply. It really starts to make people think. During the session, people are allowed to change sides at any time. If they hear some of the comments from others and like what they hear, they can change sides. The two topics we just talked about aren&rsquo;t controversial. It isn&rsquo;t until we get to the deeper subjects that people really start coming out of their comfort zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, we do a subject called <em>Love or Money</em>. Now this one is really interesting because the majority of people go over to the love side but there are always a few people who stay on the money side. I step over to speak with the people who chose money. I say to them, &ldquo;Oh, my gosh! Why did you choose money because you like to make it rain?&rdquo; They reply, &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t have money like that.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I say, &ldquo;Oh, then you must grab a whole fist full of pennies to make it hail.&rdquo; This is usually a pretty great joke to get some crowd laughter. Then the people on the money side start speaking and you can see that they have a lot of things in common. The people who really want the money say they want to work hard for what they have, money can provide them with the happiness that they need, and some say, money will never run out on you. We always take the opportunity to really dive deep into what people say. People talk about the people they love, significant others who&#39;ve left, people who&#39;ve had divorces and lost their money, or they saw issues within their families. These are big components in diversity. People&rsquo;s viewpoints are based off of their own personal experiences, not things that they&#39;d necessarily been taught or programmed to think. The things you see on TV, things you see in the media, and things you learned in school are all abstracts that program people. But, the other half of what people do is learned from their experiences. They learn through what they&rsquo;ve personally been through and what they have observed around them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After talking to the money people, I step over and talk to the people on the love side. They&rsquo;re all just so in love, but most aren&rsquo;t even talking about their own love. What they&rsquo;re trying to do is get the people over on the money side to think about how they feel. I find this so fascinating because the game is called <em>This or That</em> meaning you have the ability to think for yourself. When it comes to love or money, the people who are on the love side are always trying to convince the money people otherwise. They say, &ldquo;Money is not going to keep you warm.&rdquo; and &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re old and all you have is money, it won&rsquo;t <em>be </em>there for you.&rdquo; They add, &ldquo;Money won&rsquo;t be there for you when you&#39;re sick.&rdquo; Instead of talking about why they chose love, all they see are the people on the other side who didn&rsquo;t choose love and that becomes what&rsquo;s most important to them. It shows me that individuals sometimes have one track minds. They really want people to see something how they see it &ndash; not necessarily trying to understand that everybody has differences and sees things differently. That&#39;s why I think the game <em>This or That</em> is so important. We get to really unearth people&rsquo;s opinions, their stances, and their experiences because when you&#39;re going from one side to the other side, you don&#39;t have the ability to hide. You have to be able to back up your concepts by standing on one side or the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another controversial topic is <em>Church or No Church</em>. As soon as I call this one out, everyone is hesitant to move and choose their side. Most people wait to see what other people are going to do and then they start moving accordingly. Growing up as a Pastor&#39;s kid, I saw church very differently than how other people saw it. My dad always taught me that you welcome everybody who comes into the church &ndash; everyone from all walks of life are always welcome in God&#39;s house. It didn&rsquo;t matter what the person&rsquo;s situation was, you welcomed everybody. To say that these people are wrong or not worthy goes against the mission of the church. We all have things to work on. To see people in the church and tell them they need to fix something is wrong if you don&rsquo;t point the finger right back at yourself and say, &ldquo;What do I need to fix?&rdquo; It wasn&#39;t until I got out of my hometown that I realized that there are people that really hate churches and have had really negative experiences. Throughout these games, I saw that there were more people on the <em>No Church</em> side than on the <em>Church</em> side. I always let the lesser side, in this case the <em>Church</em> side, go first. They say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a place where I can find myself.&rdquo; and &ldquo;It&#39;s a place where I can feel at home.&rdquo; Someone usually adds, &ldquo;It&#39;s a place where I can get my spiritual rejuvenation to get me through the week.&rdquo; The people on the other side didn&rsquo;t feel that way. The people on the other side are usually there because they&rsquo;ve had a bad experience at church or in the religious community. They say, &ldquo;I used to go to church but those people don&#39;t practice what they preach.&rdquo; or &ldquo;They&rsquo;re only out for money.&rdquo; Some even say &ldquo;It&#39;s a place built on lies.&rdquo; I started to notice that people were having really bad experiences in churches and this touched me deeply. This was never my experience in my church, but it seems that is has been the experience for many people out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we have people who have good experiences and bad, we also have someone in the group who points out, &ldquo;What about those individuals who don&#39;t go to &lsquo;church&rsquo;?&rdquo; I always do my best to ignore these people because they will be integral to the discussion at the end. This game is either this or that; there is no middle. I made them choose church even though there may be people who attend other houses of worship in the audience. In this case, they may not worship in church, but maybe are Jewish and worship in synagogue or may be Muslim and worship in a mosque. Or for those people who don&#39;t go to church when they&rsquo;re at home because they worship at St. Mattress or Bedside Baptist. It isn&#39;t until we get to the next two topics, that things get more thought provoking</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of them is the topic of <em>Privilege or No Privilege</em>. How people see themselves in this world is really important here because it developed their perspective. The college students are often talking about each other when they participate in this one since they are physically moving; there seems to be a lot more judgement occurring. The people who choose the <em>Privilege</em> side say, &ldquo;Well I rather have privilege than not have it.&rdquo; They say that people who don&rsquo;t have privilege go through life in a harder way. I hear them say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in college, so I should be on the privilege side because I&rsquo;m privileged to get to go to college.&rdquo; I always ask, &ldquo;Why do you think those people are over there?&rdquo; but no one usually can give an answer. Then I ask the people on the <em>No Privilege</em> side how they feel. They say, &ldquo;Until everyone can have privilege, no one can have it.&rdquo; and &ldquo;I recognize that I was privileged growing up and I realized that some of my privileges may have taken away the privileges of others.&rdquo; These people are self-aware of their own privileges and they&rsquo;re willing to forego their privileges to ensure that everyone can be on an equal playing field. It&rsquo;s really fascinating when people start sharing and it shows perspective. This is something I am trying to help them understand; that your views and understandings vary because of your experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Privilege can be hard to understand. It is when you think something is not a problem because it&rsquo;s not a problem to you personally. Everyone goes through difficult situations in life, but the experience can be vastly different depending on your level of privilege. What you start to realize is when people are switching sides, they&#39;re not doing it because of their race, gender, sexual orientation, and so on. They&#39;re switching sides based on their beliefs. This really breaks down stereotypes and the misconceptions like &ldquo;All Black people do this.&rdquo; or &ldquo;All white people do that.&rdquo; In this activity, the participants can see the thoughts and reasoning as to why someone chose their side. They see that it is not based on the color of their skin or where they were born. Sure, these can be part of the process, a factor in their perspective, but it isn&rsquo;t the end all be all. There is so much more that goes into how a person views the world than just one aspect of their identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last topic is really important, <em>Gay or No Gay</em>. The participants are really confused about this one. They want to know what &ldquo;no gay&rdquo; means, but that&rsquo;s the point, they have to interpret it themselves &ndash; we want to discuss how they saw the options. The results are generally split with a good amount of people on both sides. When I ask the <em>No Gay</em> side, they say, &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m not gay.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I chose no gay because I don&rsquo;t personally identify with being a homosexual.&rdquo; When I go over to the <em>Gay </em>side, I hear, &ldquo;I chose this because I do support gay rights.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an ally.&rdquo; We talk about how being an ally is more than just saying something; you have to be involved. You have to be dedicated and supportive to the movement, you have to do something! Being an ally is about action, it&rsquo;s not just a status. As you can see, there are all these little educational moments inside the larger purpose. They are just as important and need to be covered. After we have some discussion, we hear some more reasoning. Some chose the <em>Gay</em> side because they are gay. Others defend the <em>No Gay</em> saying, &ldquo;I&#39;m not over here because I&#39;m a hater or against gay people.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&#39;m not someone who doesn&rsquo;t believe in LGBTQIA rights, I just don&rsquo;t identify.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s really interesting what people think about each other based on where they stand. If you take a look at all of these concepts, you don&#39;t know why people stood on a particular side, but a lot of people jump to conclusions and make assumptions about that person. When the activity is over, we process it all. Generally, they say it was fun, but really hard. When I ask them why they feel this way I hear, &ldquo;Well the game forced us to go left or right; this or that.&rdquo; I say to the team, &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s crazy because in American life, it seems like we only have two races that always fight. Which races do you think are those that are always fighting?&rdquo; The group responds, &ldquo;Black and white. Oh, I get it, that&rsquo;s how this game is&hellip;this or that, black or white.&rdquo; There has to be some gray area in there and the gray consists of all the diversity and all the different backgrounds, cultures, races, religions, sexual orientations, and abilities that the world has to offer. Things cannot be black or white &ndash; there has to be a gray area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like how you forced us to go on one side or the other; there was no middle. It didn&rsquo;t give me the ability to choose.&rdquo; I reply, &ldquo;How many of you felt like you were forced to believe something from your parents when you were growing up?&rdquo; You would be surprised at all the hands that go up. Then, we start talking about that. People say, &ldquo;Well, my parents taught me not to trust people of color.&rdquo; or &ldquo;My parents taught me that being gay is wrong.&rdquo; I often hear &ldquo;My parents taught me that religion was the only way.&rdquo; and &ldquo;My parents weren&#39;t parents at all and didn&#39;t teach me anything.&rdquo; These things have really shaped the framework and mindsets of these students. I ask, &ldquo;How many of you have been taught things by a religious organization, and now that you&#39;re a little bit older, and have gone through some things, realize that it isn&rsquo;t necessarily true?&rdquo; Again, you see all the hands go up and you see the wheels churning in their mind. Then I asked them, &ldquo;How many of you have a friend that swears they know every single thing about everything. That you have to believe what they believe because they&#39;re your friend?&rdquo; The hands go up. To lighten the mood some, I try to throw some jokes in like asking &ldquo;How many of you don&#39;t have a friend like that?&rdquo; and a few put their hands up. I end it with &ldquo;Well that means it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; I usually get a great laugh with that one and people get more at ease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The biggest thing we talk about next is that there has to be the possibility of both &ndash; you can&#39;t just say things are this or that or black or white. There has to be a neutral place where you can go on both sides. Going on both sides doesn&#39;t necessarily have to do with your color. Going on both sides could be due to your experience, what you were taught, and how you view the world. Sometimes, picking a side is difficult because each has valuable points depending on how you view it. This can make people nervous or afraid to be judged because people don&rsquo;t know your &ldquo;why,&rdquo; they just see you picking a side. That&rsquo;s why when we do <em>Church or No Church</em> I try to ignore the &ldquo;Not everyone goes to church.&rdquo; people at the time. We don&rsquo;t always have them, but when we do I try and save it for the end. I think this one emphasizes the gray area the most. It&rsquo;s not <em>Religious or Not Religious </em>or <em>Spiritual Not Spiritual</em> &ndash; it&rsquo;s a very specific place of worship. There were participants who are Jewish and attend a synagogue or Muslim and worship in a mosque. But, they still chose church because they didn&rsquo;t want to be judge as not being religious. Even though it wasn&rsquo;t their place of worship, they chose it. No one spoke up that some people go to synagogue or mosque. Why didn&rsquo;t anyone bring this up? People were afraid of being judged, so they went to the <em>Church</em> side. The people that chose <em>No Church</em>, felt like everyone was judging them. Or, they were judging on the love versus money or they or they were judging them on <em>Privilege</em> versus <em>No Privilege</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we are wrapping up <em>This or That, </em>I ask &ldquo;If you&#39;re prejudiced, please stand.&rdquo; There are usually about two people who stand. Then I say, &ldquo;So I guess the rest of you have never judged anybody before you met them? Never came to a conclusion about somebody or have preconceived notions?&rdquo; Then the entire room stands up! I ask why they didn&rsquo;t get up before and I hear &ldquo;Justin, I didn&rsquo;t stand up because I was afraid that people were going to judge me.&rdquo; I emphasize that we have to be able to own our own stuff &ndash; everyone is prejudiced. I can recall a time when I wanted to get my haircut and my barber wasn&rsquo;t available so I walked into Supercuts. There were two white ladies working. They were both really friendly and ready to help me. And what did I do? I ran out of there as fast as I could! I&rsquo;m a diversity facilitator and I judged these two because I thought there was no way they can cut a Black man&rsquo;s hair. We all have things to work on. We are all works in progress. None of us are perfect. So for us to say there&#39;s no such thing as prejudice, that&#39;s a lie. We&#39;re all just a little prejudice because we are scared of the unknown. Some are scared to have experiences with people who don&rsquo;t look like them because they are afraid of what their families or friends might think. It&#39;s the uncertainty that makes them have fear about a different situation. I find it interesting because a lot of these abstracts are taught from parents to their children. Parents are afraid, so they then reinforce their wrong ideas and teach them to their children. We need to figure out when this cycle will end. Start thinking about it. What did your parents teach you? What are some concepts you learned from your parents or a religious organization that you later found out were wrong? Now that you&rsquo;re a little older, how differently do you see it? The cycle has to end somewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to learn how to deprogram ourselves &ndash; learn to unlearn. We begin to be programmed as soon as we&#39;re born. Little boys&rsquo; rooms should be blue, they&rsquo;ll play with planes and trucks and they&rsquo;ll be a businessman. Girls should have a pink room, play with dolls, and be a stay-at-home mom. We have got to break out of these boxes we construct for ourselves. We have to let people be people. Just look at what&#39;s happening now in 2017. Recently, our president issued executive order basically saying, you can be singled out due to how you pray. That&rsquo;s immoral and unconstitutional. Again, it&rsquo;s a <em>This or That</em> situation, and depending on what you choose, could put you on a different side. We have to be able to talk about those things. The game brings up a lot of different concepts. Where would you fall on any of these topics discussed? Which side would you end up on? How would you base your decisions? Would you base it on how you were raised? Would you base it on how you were taught or what you experienced?</p>', '2020-05-29 13:26:34', '2020-05-29 13:26:34', NULL);

(4, 12, '3', '<p>Stereotypes shape our expectations about groups who are not like us. But the question is, do you believe stereotypes are accurate? If so, think of the stereotypes you feel are true. When I ask participants this question, I get the same answers: Asians are smart, blondes are ditzy, Black people like chicken, and white people are racists. I then ask where these stereotypes come from? The most frequent response is the media, specifically the news. The news conveys prejudice when it reports &ldquo;facts&rdquo; because these facts are wrapped in stories, and the stories are inevitably biased. Thus, if you don&#39;t watch the news you&rsquo;re uninformed, and if you do watch the news, you&#39;re misinformed. When I asked the group, &ldquo;What does the media suggest when there is a mass shooting done by someone from the Middle East?&rdquo; Everyone yells, &ldquo;TERRORIST!&rdquo; When I ask them, &ldquo;What does the media imply when there is a shooting by a Black person?&rdquo; The answer is usually that they are a thug or gangster. When I ask, &ldquo;What does the media say when there is a mass shooting and you&rsquo;re white?&rdquo; Everyone agrees, the media depicts them as mentally ill or having a bad day. These &ldquo;facts,&rdquo; that so many hold to be true, were weaved from a biased story that is the creation of expectations and stereotypes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next activity we do as a group, <em>Stereotype Charades,</em> is a natural progression from this point. Everyone in the audience receives a card that that contains a particular class, race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, and so on. To name a few, these include Black male, Native American, white female, person with a disability, feminist, or person from the LGBTQIA community. The goal of this activity is to create an engaging conversation about stereotypes. The instructions are for the participants act out the words on the card while the audiences guesses the identity. The outcome here is for the actor to unpack why they portrayed the card the way they did and also why the others guessed those identities. Through this process, the group can see how their experiences dictate not only why they portrayed the identity a particular way, but also why they guessed certain ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some examples of this activity. When the <em>Nerd </em>actor steps up, they usually pull their pants up to their necks and talk about all their fun homework. Everyone quickly guesses geek, nerd, Asian, or specifically, Chinese. This opens up the discussion as why they selected Asian or Chinese. People responded with &ldquo;Well you know, all Asians are smart!&rdquo; but others counter &ldquo;Trust me. I&#39;m Chinese, and I&#39;m not smart.&rdquo; Or they say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Asian, and my brother is an idiot.&rdquo; The group gets a laugh out of it, but it brings in an important point. This guides us into the deeper conversation about our perceptions of others and the stereotypes we base them off of. We look at why Chinese was the only Asian culture identify when it is just one of many. As we are wrapping this card up, I usually ask, &ldquo;So we all came to the conclusion that not all nerds are Asian, right?&rdquo; The audience agrees. But what they don&rsquo;t know is that I usually include two <em>Nerd</em> cards. We&rsquo;ll get back to that later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s funny when someone gets the <em>Black Male</em> card. They immediately get a sour look on their face and look at me thinking I&rsquo;m going to get offended. When you do diversity trainings or work with students, you&rsquo;re going to be talking about culture and background. You have to have a solid and firm heart and know that people are trying and they are learning. You can&#39;t be easily offended. People are in a learning state and they are very vulnerable. Your next statement or action could shape their entire understanding of people who look like you and their experience in diversity learning. For some people, they don&rsquo;t have to experience being a representation of their race or culture. They don&rsquo;t have to be &ldquo;on&rdquo; all the time or change who they are depending on what company they are around. This is privilege. Diversity facilitators must want to grow and develop people. Otherwise, you&#39;re going to get hurt all the time because sometimes people say things that are highly offensive. As the facilitator, it is your job to not take sides, you must remain objective. It&rsquo;s your job to provide the best possible learning experience. Anyway, back to the <em>Black Male</em> card, the person will usually ask a friend to come up, which they&rsquo;re allowed to do in <em>Stereotype Charades.</em> They usually give them a highly stylized and complex handshake. This, of course, saves the person who drew the <em>Black Male</em> card from acting out something more offensive and awkward than a handshake. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Black Female</em> card is interesting too because depending on your geographic background, people act it out differently. Normally when someone gets the Black female card, they say things such as, &ldquo;Hey girl, I&rsquo;m about to fight, let me take my earrings off!&rdquo; Or they pretend they have a bigger butt. At one particular event at the University of Florida, a Japanese woman acted out the <em>Black Female</em> card by saying, &ldquo;At one point, I was a queen and now I have been lowered to just a sexual object.&rdquo; No one knew what she was referring too. She also said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the strongest person in my household.&rdquo; No one guessed correctly. Her acting was based upon her experience. She was a foreign exchange student and had been living with a Black family and that was her experience. That was her only perception of a Black female. In the media, do we depict Black women as simply sexual objects or women who just have big butts and big lips? Do they go beyond their hips or is it more than just the Black genes that make the blue jeans tight? More extremely are Black women even respected in their own culture?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next comes the <em>Arab Male </em>card. Now remember, just because I&rsquo;m a diversity facilitator, doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m not human. I&rsquo;ve made wrong mistakes and assumptions. The <em>Arab Male</em> card gives me an opportunity to tell this story. I remember being on a plane with my family traveling to Orlando for vacation. This occurred right after the 9/11 and everybody was on high alert for anybody who appeared to be of Middle Eastern descent. Obviously, just because someone is of Middle Eastern descent doesn&#39;t mean they are a terrorist. But this was a lesson I had to learn the hard way. I remember watching how the media depicted these individuals as evil. I remember feeling scared to even board the plane. I remember sitting in the middle seat between my dad in the aisle seat and a Middle Eastern man by the window. I recall he was nervous the entire plane ride. He was shaking back and forth and looking behind him. It freaked me out. I remember saying to my dad, multiple times, &ldquo;Dad, something is wrong with this guy. We need to get up. We need to tell someone &ndash; tell the pilot. Don&rsquo;t forget those terrorist training videos we saw. We&rsquo;re supposed to get up and alert someone, Dad.&rdquo; My dad said, &ldquo;Justin, shut up! We&rsquo;re fine. Just relax!&rdquo; But I continued, &ldquo;No dad! He&rsquo;s shaking.&rdquo; I remember the guy getting up three or four times and going to the back of the plane. I kept saying to my dad, &ldquo;Dad, Dad, what&rsquo;s going on with this guy? Now&rsquo;s the time we need to say something! He&#39;s going to come back up here and do something!&rdquo; Again, my dad told me to relax. Right before we landed, the man went to the back of the plane again and didn&rsquo;t come back to his seat. Once we safely landed, I remember looking towards the back of the plane and I saw him standing with a woman and newborn baby. I assume this was his family he was separated from during the flight and he was anxious not being with them. I felt like such a jerk when I saw that. The reason why he was so nervous and the reason he kept getting up and going to the back of the plane was so that he could check on his wife and baby. It had nothing to do with him being a terrorist. At that moment, I realized, stereotypes really separate people. Stereotyping puts up barriers that don&rsquo;t allow us to go beyond what we think is true. It also prevents us from having authentic experiences with one another. I digress &ndash; back to the game!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the next cards I give out is the <em>Feminist</em> card. Normally, you get someone who is just completely irate and says that men are dogs and that women should take over things. The audience generally confirms that this extreme representation is a feminist. I start the discussion by asking how many people consider themself to be a feminist. Only a few people raise their hands, so I ask &ldquo;How many of you are not feminists?&rdquo; The majority of the crowd raises their hand, so I ask individuals why. I generally hear &ldquo;Well, I&#39;m not a feminist because feminism doesn&rsquo;t mean being equal to men. It really is an extreme movement and it hurts men.&rdquo; Or I might hear, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a feminist because being a feminist nowadays doesn&#39;t help you if you&rsquo;re a woman of color; it only helps you if you&rsquo;re a white woman.&rdquo; On this particular day, I remember calling on someone who was very eager to explain why she wasn&rsquo;t a feminist. So I asked her, &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you a feminist?&rdquo; Her reply was, &ldquo;Justin (pops gums), I am not a feminist because bras are just too expensive!&rdquo; I gave this woman the craziest look I could muster. She said, &ldquo;Justin, I&rsquo;m not gonna be going down the street burning my bras. Do you know how much a bra costs at Victoria&#39;s Secret?&rdquo; I immediately responded, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; considering that I&#39;ve never actually been in the store, let alone purchased a bra. I had to explain to her that the feminist movement has changed over the years. Chances are you&#39;re not going to someone on the street burning a bra. Actually, the burning of bras was a myth &ndash; they were just thrown into a trash can during the 1968 Miss America pageant in protest. Either way, you have to go back to the start with the women&rsquo;s suffrage movement and every wave that happened after. Sure, there may have been some extreme things done, but they were extreme times. Women were trying to gain the right to vote. They were trying to gain the ability to have rights as a person, not as an object owned by men. They were trying to gain the right to buy land. They were trying to gain rights over their own bodies. There were a lot of things to be accomplished over the years. To wrap up this discussion, I asked how many people believe in the equality of everyone. They all raised their hands. I said, &ldquo;Congratulations! You are all feminists! Give yourselves a round of applause!&rdquo; The looks on the faces of the crowd are priceless. I see the awe and wonder of them thinking &ldquo;Wow, maybe I&#39;m not quite sure of the definitions of these words. Maybe I don&rsquo;t fully know what these concepts are.&rdquo; That is the point of the <em>Stereotype Charades. </em>It provides a springboard to dive into the definitions and get the meanings out there in a humorous, yet informative manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along with the thought provoking cards we already went over, another interesting one is <em>White Woman</em>. It&#39;s funny because normally someone gets up and says, &ldquo;Oh my God, Becky!&rdquo; in the most annoying, valley girl voice possible. In the beginning, a lot of people are yelling out gay person. I always find that interesting because not all people from the LGBTQIA community are flamboyant. Once we get past the fact that it&rsquo;s not a gay person, people usually get it immediately. Like, &ldquo;Oh my gosh&hellip;.white girl, it&rsquo;s a white girl!&rdquo; I recall an example when I did a training for over 600 Resident Assistants at a university up north. A young lady got up to act out a card and said, &ldquo;Oh my God, I totally have to go to Starbucks and I&#39;m wearing UGG boots and my North Face jacket and I have a little dog in my purse!&rdquo; And no one yelled out &ldquo;White girl!&rdquo; like I usually hear. Instead, everyone started yelling out, &ldquo;Basic, basic, basic!&rdquo; I&#39;m sitting there dumbstruck and ask what they are talking about. They said, &ldquo;Come on Justin, you know, basic white girl. Don&rsquo;t you know what that is?&rdquo; I&#39;m like, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; They go on to explain, &ldquo;You know, like she walks around really happy. Her hair and nails are always done. She has a little dog in her purse. She wears a North Face jacket and UGG boots. You know&hellip;basic!&rdquo; I had to ask, &ldquo;Well, how do you become advanced white girl? Is there a test you have to take? If you pass you become an advanced white girl but if you fail, you&rsquo;re intermediate white girl?&rdquo; Then silly me as a facilitator, I ask all the women of color in the room, &ldquo;Is there such a thing as a basic Black girl?&rdquo; They all angrily respond, &ldquo;NOPE! And there never will be!&rdquo; Everybody gets a good laugh out of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since they&rsquo;re all laughing and everything is at a good point, I pose the question, &ldquo;Where do we get off calling each other basic? When I look around this room, I see unique people with unique figures, sizes, shapes, eye color, hair color, skin tone, and hair texture. When did it become a comedy to call people basic?&rdquo; People usually respond, &ldquo;Well, basic is when you&#39;re doing the same thing that everybody else is doing; you&#39;re not unique.&rdquo; When I hear this, I ask &ldquo;What do we do with people who don&rsquo;t fit outside the box?&rdquo; People in the audience start talking and thinking out loud and I hear &ldquo;Those people are usually ostracized. Those people are usually called weird.&rdquo; This really begs the question as to where our priorities lie as a country or as humans in this world. Where do we get off immediately labeling people? Pointing out to them that they are different, that they don&rsquo;t fit in the box with everyone else, thus making them an &ldquo;other.&rdquo; As a society, we focus so much on social identities that we forget to look at individual personalities or characteristics. We define who someone is based on similarities or differences to the social norm thereby creating a dichotomy. This dichotomy then leaves a distinct otherness &ndash; the other being someone who doesn&rsquo;t fit in. They don&rsquo;t fit in because we created a stark difference &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and &ldquo;odd,&rdquo; and that will always leave people on the outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another interesting topic in <em>Stereotype Charades </em>is brought up through the <em>Handicap </em>card. Nearly always, the person with this card grabs a chair and pretends they are in a wheelchair. The audiences guesses the identity fairly quickly in this scenario. However, one time the actor got up and just stood there. They didn&rsquo;t say anything and they didn&rsquo;t act anything out. This confused a lot of people, but showed a valuable point &ndash; not all disabilities are visible. You can&rsquo;t tell if someone has a learning disability, mental health concerns, or if they have a disease or disorder. Again, not all disabilities are seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people even think that individuals with autism are completely disabled and try to assign what they can or cannot do. I have to politely correct them and state that when you meet someone with autism, you are meeting one person with autism. There is no line that defines all people with autism &ndash; we are unique and special.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I challenge people during this part of the program because they use phrasing such as disabled person or handicapped person. No one ever identifies the person first, the focus is on the disability. They are people with a disability or people with a handicap &ndash; the personhood comes first. Sometimes, people don&rsquo;t even consider themselves to have a disability, but rather a <em>different</em> ability that doesn&rsquo;t define them. I have a friend with a hearing disability, but believes he has a gift and not a shortcoming. He believes he was specially chosen to be part of the Deaf community. The more I learned from him, the more I learned about the Deaf community. Having a hearing loss is not the short end of the stick, but the beginning of limitless possibilities in this community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Identity is a reflexive process. We call forth one another&rsquo;s identity in part by our conversations with and about one another. To a certain extent we are who the world expects us to be. We become one another&rsquo;s expectations; expectations formed by the power of our words to construct identity. We shape how people view themselves. We shape as how they come to terms with their reality by how we refer to them and how we treat them. My understanding of people with disabilities came through the eyes of my older brother, born with cerebral palsy. He was permanently wheelchair bound. He couldn&rsquo;t walk by himself, feed himself, clothe himself, or even speak. Therefore, it was up to us, as a family, to pitch in and take care of my brother. He was more than just a brother to me, he was my best friend. I saw firsthand how people who had disabilities were treated. Again, my brother having a disability was normal to me because that is how he always was. If nothing else, I had no idea something was wrong until we went out in public. People would stare, laugh, and even sometimes point in ridicule. It was then that I realized, &ldquo;Wait a minute something&#39;s not right here! What&rsquo;s wrong with my brother?&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Growing up with my brother taught me many different things, one of the biggest was patience. It taught me to be empathetic with those who had disabilities. It taught me that communication isn&#39;t always through spoken or written words &ndash; it&#39;s also trying to experience life the same way another person does. So, I don&#39;t have a problem talking with people who are Deaf. I don&rsquo;t know sign language, but I am going to seek to connect with them. I don&rsquo;t have a problem communicating with someone who is blind and I don&rsquo;t have a problem with someone&rsquo;s inability to walk. We communicate by simply stepping out of our comfort zone and into the comfort zone of another. It is simply a choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;I thoroughly remember the summer Pok&eacute;mon Go came out. It was a very popular mobile app at the time and everybody had it. I remember playing everywhere, even one day at the edge of a field. There, I saw a young lady also playing Pokemon Go, but she wasn&rsquo;t going into the field. I assume this was because she was in a wheelchair and the grass was thick. She looked so frustrated and I think she was going after the same Pok&eacute;mon as me. I asked her, &ldquo;Hey, are you looking for that Charmander?&rdquo;&nbsp; She replied, &ldquo;Yeah, but I can&#39;t get out there.&rdquo; I asked her, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Because I&#39;m in a wheelchair, duh!&rdquo; Really, I wanted to show her that I hadn&rsquo;t just seen the wheelchair, but that I saw her. In the end, I took both our phones into the field and found that Charmander for both of us!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, is the <em>LGBTQIA</em> card. I&rsquo;ve heard, &ldquo;Oh my God!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hey girl!&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve also seen the person acting out this card walking with their hands on their hips or grabbing someone of the same sex. Because most of the US population are cisgender and heterosexual individuals, most of the participants are as well. Thus they base their understanding of the LGBTQIA community on the media or their personal experiences. This card is usually guessed very quickly. It&rsquo;s interesting when we have to break down those stereotypes, especially when it comes to the <em>Tran</em>s card because people often have incorrect preconceived notions about the LGBTQIA community. It&#39;s fascinating when I return to Coatesville, PA, my hometown, and see a friend I grew up with. In the course of our conversation, they might compliment me but immediately follows that compliment with the phrase, &ldquo;No-homo.&rdquo;&nbsp; Essentially when they&rsquo;re saying this, they&rsquo;re saying I want to compliment you, but I also want to remind you I&#39;m not gay. Even though we&#39;ve been friends since the age of twelve and you already know my sexual orientation just in case you forgot, please let me remind you every single opportunity I get that I am not gay. The phrase &ldquo;no-homo&rdquo; is actually a barrier that implies, I want to compliment you, but I also don&#39;t want you to misinterpret my compliment as a come-on because gay is bad, and I am good. I try to challenge my friends by saying, &ldquo;Hey man, what if I said this to you? You lookin&rsquo; real nice in that suit, no-negro.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then they realize &ldquo;no-homo&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t make any sense at all; just like saying, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s so gay&rdquo; or &ldquo;that&rsquo;s so retarded.&rdquo; We have to learn to use words precisely. There are so many adjectives and verbs in the English language that can describe something we don&rsquo;t like. I am here to tell you &ldquo;gay&rdquo; or &ldquo;retarded&rdquo; are not those words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the phrase &ldquo;no-homo&rdquo; as a student affairs professional, I&#39;m hearing another word that highly concerns me. I often ask students how their day is going. Sometimes they respond with, say that the day is &ldquo;raping them&rdquo; or that a test totally &ldquo;raped&rdquo; them. Using the word rape in everyday conversation trivializes the trauma of rape. Casual and frequent use of the word rape minimizes its horror and normalizes the word. If this trend continues, the words define will change &ndash; people may no longer perceive it as a violent assault or traumatic experience. The culture of sexual assault on college campuses and society in general is perpetuated by how we label it. Far more apt words can be used to describe a bad day than the word rape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Queer&rdquo; is also a word that is used differently than its original definition intended, though not in a destructive way. People in the LGBTQIA community have reclaimed this word &ndash; they have taken ownership and removed the derogatory connotation. Actually, it is likely that someone in LGBTQIA community will use &ldquo;queer&rdquo; over &ldquo;homosexual.&rdquo; One reason the LGBTQIA community is less likely to use the word &quot;homosexual&quot; is because it creates a dichotomy &ndash; either homosexual or heterosexual, as though there are only two choices. In fact sexual orientation is fluid, so a person can identify their sexual orientation in multiple ways beyond homosexual. Thus, many people in the community do not find the word homosexual appealing or appropriate. Creating and embracing a diverse community starts with respect for difference which is nurtured by open dialogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, I sometimes attend conferences and workshops that aren&rsquo;t very good. I also like to go to workshops that are going to be controversial so I can bring up some interesting concepts. I remember going to a workshop called, <em>Transgender, the New Phenomenon.</em> I recall just staring at the programming workbook as I was deciding what programs I wanted to attend and I was thinking, &ldquo;Really, the <em>new </em>phenomenon?!?&rdquo; As if people just automatically started becoming trans yesterday like it was a new fad. Yes, it might be more prevalent now because individuals have found the strength to come out, but it&rsquo;s not new. There&rsquo;s a difference between transgender and transsexual, just like there is a difference between gay, queer, asexual, and so on. You have to know the terms and know what you are talking about. That&rsquo;s also important if you&rsquo;re going to speak about a different culture, ethnicity, religious group, or sexual orientation; you have to have friends and you have to be an ally. Being an ally is a call to action. It&#39;s a movement and it&rsquo;s being in the community. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s knowing when to speak and when to sit back. It&rsquo;s knowing you can&#39;t speak on those experiences, but instead have to encourage the voice of another. Sometimes you can be the best support system by just being there and not saying anything at all. Usually the person who&#39;s the loudest in the room isn&rsquo;t the smartest. It&#39;s the individuals who are sitting back, listening, and taking account of what is happening who have plenty of beneficial things to say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a Preacher&rsquo;s kid, I realize being a LGBTQIA ally might be controversial for some people. From my perspective as a Christian man, I&#39;m not responsible for what people do in their life. Instead, I have to worry about what I&#39;m doing in my life. I value everyone and respect their identities. Who they love does not change their worth to me. My problem in this area is getting people to want to come to church because their past experiences were so negative. People ask me, &ldquo;Well how can you be a Christian and support LGBTQIA rights?&rdquo; I respond by saying as a Christian, I am called to love everybody. I am called to love everybody, no matter where their life has taken them. For me to say one group is worse than another would make me a hypocrite and that wouldn&rsquo;t make me a very good Christian, would it?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why my stance is that &ndash; I am a Christian and I am called to love everyone, period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next card I&rsquo;m going to explain is not controversial so much as misunderstood, the <em>Veteran</em> card. Once when a participant got this card, they acted like a lunatic shouting and screaming crazy sounds and words, not making any sense. To me veterans are people who go out there and risk their lives to protect our liberties and freedom. That day, there was a veteran in the audience. He said, &ldquo;I can&#39;t believe you think that! I didn&rsquo;t go overseas, away from my family, and fight so that you could think I am crazy. I was fighting for this country as whole, yet when I was away, this country started taking away the rights of my wife and daughter. That is not what I was fighting for.&rdquo; Reflecting on this, we see that we have dedicated men and women who are fighting for our freedom each day. Yet, when they return, they are not respected and even ostracized because of the psychological effects of war. Even more so, as this veteran described, they are off fighting for a country that doesn&rsquo;t value their loved ones on home soil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We finally get to the most controversial card out of all of the cards &ndash; <em>White Male</em>. I recall giving a <em>White Male</em> card to a white male once. He looked at me and said, &ldquo;Justin, I don&rsquo;t know how to act this out.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Man, just act it out the best way you can.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Dude, I don&#39;t know how to do this.&rdquo; I told him to try his best. He gets up in front of the room, looks straight out into the audience, takes a deep breath and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m normal.&rdquo; The whole crowd went wild. They were shouting, &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; and &ldquo;That&#39;s terrible!&rdquo; while continuing to mutter. My question to every audience I ever speak to is, &ldquo;Was he wrong?&rdquo; When you think about the American Dream, you think about the two story house with two garages, a pool in the backyard with a swing set for the 2.5 children to play on. You think about the businessman who runs his own businesses and a woman who stays at home with the children, waiting for her husband to come home so she can take care of him. When you think about that American Dream, did you think of someone who is Black, someone who is Asian, or someone who is Latinx? No, you only really thought of people who are white and that was this kid&rsquo;s normal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s always interesting depending on who is in the audience at the training or workshop. I did a training at Lincoln University, which is one of the first HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges or Universities) ever created. The training was for all Black males. Of course, someone had to get the <em>White Male</em> card. The person got up and said, &ldquo;Well, I guess I gotta go buy some New Balance shoes!&rdquo; The crowd laughed hysterically. We, of course, interpret stereotypes within the context of our own life experiences. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, when we define stereotypes, the students and I usually conclude that stereotypes are based on a kernel of truth, but they&#39;re not absolutes. We can only really understand others&rsquo; perspectives once we interact with those who are different than us. So you, the person reading this book right now, are you engaging in conversations with people who are different than you? When was the last time you ate with someone you didn&#39;t know, someone of a different race? Would you invite them into your home or introduced them to your family? Would you go to their house or participate in their religious or cultural events? At the end of the day, you have to ask yourself, &ldquo;Am I truly attempting to understand people who are different than I am or am I fake?&rdquo; If your answer is, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cool with everybody,&rdquo; but at the same time, there&#39;s something about &ldquo;that person&rdquo; that makes you feel uncomfortable (and everybody has those feelings, including me) you&rsquo;re pretending. You have to move past those feelings in order to break barriers and build bridges. Talk to someone different &ndash; you might surprise yourself. Break down your walls &ndash; learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable and push forward.</p>', '2020-05-29 13:27:18', '2020-05-29 13:27:18', NULL);

(5, 13, '4', '<p>You can tell by the chapter title, this is going to be a controversial topic &ndash; white privilege. You might think I&#39;m biased because I am a man of color, but I always try to give my honest views on both sides of any particular issue. That being said white privilege is a systematic framework that allows some people to have better and more opportunities, solely based on the color of their skin. This often is related to societal and educational privileges that benefit individuals who are white, or appear to be white. But, do I think that ALL white people are privileged. Absolutely not! I don&#39;t think white people wake up in the morning, look in the mirror, and say, &ldquo;Yes! Still white!&rdquo; No, it doesn&rsquo;t happen like that. Just like Black people don&rsquo;t wake up in the morning and think, &ldquo;Aww man, still a minority!&rdquo; A great comparison to aid with understanding white privilege is to look at Mario Kart. You can&#39;t be in first place and also get the blue shell &ndash; the players in the back need that to reduce the gap. White privilege is just like that, the people in the front tend to get more opportunities even though they are already ahead of the others. This increases the space between the front and the back. In reality, those in the back need the blue shell, chain chomp, a star man, Bullet Bill, and so on. They need the resources and opportunities, so that they can catch up in society. We need to make sure everyone has the resources to succeed. I&#39;ve seen it my whole life as a Black man, but I&rsquo;ve also seen some white people who use white privilege to benefit others. In the area where I grew up, my best friend is a tall, white, Irish, male with a giant red beard named Shamus. We&rsquo;ve been best friends since we were in sixth grade. We&#39;ve learned so many things about each other growing up, so I definitely can understand some aspects of living in this world as a white person. I can&#39;t understand all of it, just like not everyone would be able to understand my position as a Black man. So, for me to sit here and say that every single white person is privileged is absolutely false. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hear people say, &ldquo;White people do this.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Black people do that.&rdquo; What we should say is, &ldquo;<em>some </em>white people do this.&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Some </em>Black people do that.&rdquo; But in the end, it&rsquo;s not even about race. We are all so much more than one aspect of our identities. That is not to say one aspect of our identity is not more salient than another, but that it is not everything we are. In fact we sometimes invalidate other people&#39;s experiences by either speaking for them or saying something that silences them. I clearly remember one time being told by someone who was white, &ldquo;No Justin, I don&rsquo;t know why you feel that way; it didn&rsquo;t happen like that.&rdquo; We have to be careful to not invalidate people&rsquo;s experiences just because those experiences didn&rsquo;t happen to us personally or affect us personally. The key here is how it affects that person, because it is about that person&rsquo;s experience, not the other person&#39;s perception of that experience. Keep in mind that it&rsquo;s not just white people who misspeak. As I mentioned in a previous chapter, if you don&rsquo;t identify with the subgroup mentioned, it&#39;s best to be quiet. One of the activities that people play all the time in diversity programs, which I don&rsquo;t care for, is a game called <em>Cross the Line</em>. In <em>Cross the Line</em>, a diverse group of people stand in a line and are asked a series of questions. If the question applies to them, they move forward, if it doesn&rsquo;t apply to them, they move back. For example, &ldquo;If you had books in your house, please step forward; if you didn&rsquo;t, please step back.&rdquo; Another common one is &ldquo;If your parents had jobs move forward; if they didn&rsquo;t, step back.&rdquo; Even something like &ldquo;If you went on family vacations, step forward; if you didn&rsquo;t, step back.&rdquo; The different questions revolve around social economic status, racism, access to higher education, and so on. In most cases, the white people end up stepping forward to show how privileged they are and the minorities are moving back. Or in a particular case, a question such as, &ldquo;Has anyone in your family ever been subject to drug use?&rdquo; and somebody from a minority background steps forward. At this point, people in the back are usually whispering, &ldquo;Oh my gosh, I didn&rsquo;t know Darryl had to go through that!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The game is supposed to highlight privilege, but I think it has an adverse effect as well &ndash; it highlights those who have had more difficulties in their lives. <em>Cross the Line</em> is more often than not a game that exposes those who are economically and socially underprivileged. Statistically, minorities are more likely to fall in this category than those in the dominant culture. So while those in the dominant culture might feel &ldquo;white guilt,&rdquo; those on the other side of the line might feel embarrassed or even ashamed. No one learns anything except that the activity they have just participated in makes them feel badly about themselves. <em>Cross the Line</em> highlights issues we&rsquo;re already aware of without providing solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve altered this activity to create a game that yields positive results. I made up a questionnaire with all the same questions. The difference is that it is taken anonymously. After participants fill out the questionnaire, I collect them, shuffle them, and redistribute them to different people. This is important for a couple of reasons. First, I want to give individuals the opportunity to walk in someone else&#39;s shoes. This helps participants come out of their own experiences and backgrounds. Ultimately it allows them to see through another person&rsquo;s eyes. Secondly, the game allows individuals to go through the simulation without fear of being judged or fear of outing themselves. The participants only know that there is someone in the room who is going through this or has experienced this, but the identity remains secured. The processing of this modified game is very different when it comes to understanding privilege. Now, individuals are looking around the room at each other thinking there&rsquo;s someone in the room that didn&rsquo;t have some of the things they did such as books, clean water, or a private education. They learn someone in the group has gone through struggles or hardships such as a parent who is an addict or who has been in jail, but that person&rsquo;s identity is protected. So, we are able to see that these issues exist, that this has been someone&rsquo;s experience, but the spotlight isn&rsquo;t on that person, it is on the sheet of paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result is that participants understand more clearly where they stand on the continuum of privilege and how this privilege might have given them a head start towards the success we&rsquo;re all seeking. Quite recently, I facilitated a diversity training about white privilege. I was sitting next to a white woman who was huffing and puffing the entire time, making noises like she was just disgusted with the topic of white privilege. Finally, I asked her if she was okay and she said, &ldquo;Yes. I just feel guilty.&rdquo; I asked her what she meant and she replied, &ldquo;Well, this guilt is just a result of the racist treatment that minorities have to suffer due to my race!&rdquo; She looked me right in my face, with tears in her eyes and said, &ldquo;Justin, I am so sorry for my whiteness!&rdquo; I looked at her and said, &ldquo;Okkkaaayy?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;No, no, no, I just, I just want you to know that I don&#39;t see you as a color; I just see you as Justin.&rdquo; I looked her right in her face and said, &ldquo;Really? Because every morning I wake up and look in the mirror, I know I&#39;m Black!&rdquo; It would be really funny to me to see what she would do at a traffic light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point of this story is not to trivialize feelings of white guilt but to highlight that we really need to go beyond this color thing. Is there a privilege to being Black? For most people, the concepts of societal advantages for being Black are little to none. But to me, there are some benefits of being Black. It is not just Black and white people who are at odds with one another. If during a program, I ask &ldquo;If you don&#39;t identify with being Black or white, please stand.&rdquo; You can see that there are individuals who don&#39;t identify as Black or white, yet they are not brought into the conversation. These individuals are not consulted about how they feel because we are so focused on the divide between Black and white. When we don&#39;t give other individuals a choice, it again, puts us back into this black or white dichotomy. We have to look at the gray area and get everybody&#39;s perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked this in a previous chapter, but how many of you are intentional about creating and having a diverse experience? About living out the value of diversity? Whether it&#39;s with your students, coworkers, staff, friends, or family? How many of you are determined to try different foods, travel to a different country, or learn about a different culture? If you&rsquo;re not intentional about living out the value of diversity, you&rsquo;re not taking full advantage of what this world has to offer. Some people think this country is divided. Some people think this country is a melting pot. I, on the other hand, think this country is a salad! It has vegetables, fruits, herbs, nuts and different colors, textures, shapes, and tastes. We need to be able to appreciate all of those things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a student affairs professional, I get some very interesting calls sometimes from some of my colleagues. I don&#39;t know if they know they are doing this, but I definitely call some of them out on it when it&rsquo;s necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what some of the calls sound like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Ring, Ring, Ring.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justin: Hello.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colleague:&nbsp; Hi Justin! How are you? (Extremely high pitched voice, kind of nervous)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justin:&nbsp; I&rsquo;m doing good. How are you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colleague: Great! Great! Great! Hey listen, I have this student that I know you&rsquo;d be great in mentoring!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh my gosh, this student would really benefit from your leadership and knowledge (extremely excited, high pitched voice).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justin: Uh huh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colleague: Do you mind if I send them over? Like, would that be okay? (Nervous and high pitched voice)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justin: Yes, of course. Go ahead and send them over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colleague: Thank you Justin! You&rsquo;re the best!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justin: Uh huh. Bye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in my mind, and in your mind right now, what do you think is taking place? Do you think a student is just going to benefit from my knowledge and experience? Now sure, sometimes that could be the case, but most of the time, it&rsquo;s not. When we talk about intentionality versus intent, we have to look at what&#39;s really being said here. In this situation, you know the intent is to butter me up to handle a potentially difficult student. What I know the intentionality to be is, the student that is coming to see me, is a student of color. Low and behold, five minutes later, a student of color walks in my office. Is it because we as student affairs professionals don&#39;t know how to challenge and support all of our students? Is it because we don&#39;t want to deal with issues regarding students of color &ndash; as if their issues are different than any other student? All students, all people want to be heard and accepted for who they are. If you&rsquo;re floundering, start there. As a Black student affairs professional, I have to challenge and support white students. I don&rsquo;t call my white colleagues and say, I have a student you would be a great mentor for &ndash; they&rsquo;re white and you&rsquo;re white, so boom, make magic happen! That&#39;s not a conversation that I have or that any of us should be having. We have to look at the intent versus the intentionality because as a student affairs professional, you didn&#39;t hire me because I was Black, at least I hope not. In some cases, at some institutions, that actually does happen. When you&#39;re hiring professionals that happen to be of color, you&#39;re not just hiring a Black face you&#39;re also hiring a Black voice. If the voice makes you feel uncomfortable, go with that feeling, there is probably a lesson coming your way that you need to hear. I&rsquo;m encouraging everyone, regardless of color, to use their voices to speak out about social injustices. Use your voices to speak out if you see issues of inequality that are not only happening within our communities but on our campuses, in our religious establishments, in our households, and ultimately, in our nation. Our voices share our experiences. Our voices support each other. Our voices raise awareness. Our voices challenge stereotypes. Our voices call attention to the changes we need in our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are just some things white people don&#39;t have to go through and can&rsquo;t conceptualize. As I mentioned before, growing up, I had friends of all different races and backgrounds. You have to assimilate and adapt to whatever community you&#39;re in. I remember telling my white friends how I grew up and they just couldn&#39;t believe it. I asked them, &ldquo;What did your parents tell you when you were growing up and went into a store?&rdquo; My white friends had no idea what I was talking about. I told them, &ldquo;When I go into a store, as a Black male, I have to worry about making sure the clerk sees me immediately and sees that my hands are out of my pockets. If I&rsquo;m not buying an item, I know not to pick it up. I make sure I&rsquo;m friendly, smile, keep my hands at my sides, don&rsquo;t make a lot of noise, don&#39;t run around, and don&rsquo;t look suspicious. These are the things my parents taught me.&rdquo; My white friends couldn&rsquo;t understand and questioned me, &ldquo;What? Why would you have to worry about those things? If you didn&rsquo;t do anything, you have nothing to do worry about?!? Right, Justin?&rdquo; Those are the things as Black men we have to learn and carry with us. I don&rsquo;t necessarily think it&rsquo;s the fault of all white people for not understanding this. These are not things that you think about, so why worry about them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, most of you reading this book are not diagnosed with cancer. So, on a daily basis, you&rsquo;re not thinking about cancer. Why? Because you don&rsquo;t have to! It&rsquo;s the same thing with individuals of color. You&rsquo;re not of color, so you don&#39;t think about issues that people of color deal with every day. But they. Let&rsquo;s look at another example &ndash; you are driving your car and get pulled over by the cops. As a white male, chances are you&rsquo;re wondering what you did wrong, but you&rsquo;re not fearful for your life. Every time I see a cop, my heart races. But I&#39;m a Black man, I&#39;m supposed to be strong, I&#39;m supposed to be fearless! Those are traits of Black men right? No! When I see a cop my heart starts beating quickly because I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen. I don&#39;t know if this is going to be the last time I&#39;m going to live or the last time I talk to my parents. This isn&rsquo;t even solely based upon what you see in media. This is based upon experiences that I&#39;ve had personally. I grew up in an all-white neighborhood for the latter part of my childhood. My family moved when my youngest sister was born. We were the second house in the development. All of the other houses were built after we moved in. I remember whenever we would see any of our new neighbors, who were all white, they would all say, &ldquo;Hi! Welcome to our neighborhood! When did you move in?&rdquo; We just looked at them all crazy, thinking, &ldquo;No! When did YOU move in? We were here first!&rdquo; I can&#39;t tell you the number of times my family and I were pulled over in our own neighborhood! Pulled over on the way to work! Pulled over on our way to church! Then, have to prove to the police that we live right there...that&rsquo;s our house! When do you ever have to prove that you live somewhere?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the fear part is important. Has a cop ever shot at me? No. Have I ever been falsely arrested? No. But you have to look at transgenerational trauma &ndash; the trauma that is transferred from the first generation to the current offspring. It&rsquo;s very similar to post-traumatic stress disorder reactions. Can you think of anything that has happened in American history that could cause Black people to not trust people who are white? What about the indigenous people who lived here before anyone else? Do you think they have suffered from transgenerational trauma?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, sometimes some white people don&#39;t understand or even realize some of the things that people of color go through. When you&#39;re well-spoken as a white male, does anyone ever compliment you on your ability to speak effectively? No! I can&#39;t tell you how many times I have been complimented and praised because I happen to sound &ldquo;articulate.&rdquo;&nbsp; It <em>almost</em> comes off as a compliment, but it has a sense of being underhanded, hence microaggressions. Throughout my education, I recall a lot of my professors commenting on how &ldquo;well-spoken&rdquo; I was. I&rsquo;m sure some of you reading this are thinking, well maybe your professors were just complimenting you? But I counter and ask, maybe they could have just told me I did a good job! &ldquo;Good job&rdquo; would be a normal response, but as a Black man, I&rsquo;m told, &ldquo;You speak so proficiently.&rdquo; or &ldquo;You speak so eloquently.&rdquo; Those type of compliments are different. They don&#39;t come off as praise. If anything, they come off as insults because I defy their expectations of what a Black man is supposed to sound like! Aww c&rsquo;mon, Justin, you&rsquo;re being too sensitive...maybe you&rsquo;re taking it the wrong way! If you thought this, let&#39;s talk again about validating others experiences. What I&rsquo;ve explained is how this experience made me feel...this is how I perceived it and how it affects me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing up, I felt like I had to be twice as good as my white peers just to be accepted. In high school, I was in AP classes and I didn&rsquo;t see many people that looked like me. Out of my class of 24, there were only three students of color, when in fact the school was 40% students of color. In college, I didn&#39;t see many people who looked like me either. My undergraduate cohort of 65 students only included 12 students of color. In student leadership groups, I didn&#39;t see many people who looked like me. In my graduate program, I saw no one who looked like me! When I think about my professors, through all six years of college thus far, I&rsquo;ve only had two professors who were people of color. When you don&#39;t see people who look like you in the different aspects of your life, it can be difficult. You learn to assimilate so that you can bridge the gap that makes you an outsider. You do this so that you can be seen as an equal, a counterpart, and be valued as a member of the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way I act with my friends, behind closed doors, is not how I act when I&#39;m working in the office because it is not the atmosphere or culture of the workplace. For other people who blend in with the majority, how many times do you have to change your personality or behavior to accommodate your immediate social environment? Some aspects of our identity are invisible or can be hidden. But as a Black male, the color of my skin automatically sets me apart. Thus assimilating with my social environment is not just to fit in, but is absolutely necessary for my very survival. Again, this chapter isn&rsquo;t to say that ALL white people are prejudiced because I don&#39;t believe that. Some of my best friends are white! Historically, not all white people were slave owners. There were white people helping in the Underground Railroad. Not everyone in the 1960s was pro-segregation. There were white people who joined the Freedom Rides and at the Million Man March. When the Black Lives Matter movement happened, there were white people participating, just like there were Black people participating. White people are not the enemy! Unfortunately, from a historical perspective, many white people were pictured as the villains, but in reality, only some were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to privilege, unfortunately, some white people are the only ones benefiting. Again, privilege is when you think something is not a problem, because it&#39;s not a problem for you personally. I do feel that white privilege is something that has to be talked about. You can&rsquo;t just have white privilege and put it in your backpack. You have to check your privilege and the bigotry that goes with it; it is just something that we have to learn to make our society better. We all have to do this, not just white people. Anyone who identifies with a majority class &ndash; race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender representation, religion &ndash; has to work towards checking their privilege. It is not automatic. Unfortunately, in our society being a cisgender, heterosexual, white, Christian male holds the most privilege and some abuse it. Look at our current political climate where these men are not checking their privilege because if it is not a problem for them, it&rsquo;s not a problem at all! We have to be able to look at it from both perspectives &ndash; as someone who has the privilege and someone who doesn&rsquo;t. And we need to call attention to it so that as a society we can re-learn and grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you still don&rsquo;t think white privilege exists, then congratulations! You&rsquo;re enjoying the benefits of it. It does exist and it&rsquo;s something that really does separate our society. As I mentioned before, one aspect of white privilege means that you can be &ldquo;articulate&rdquo; and &ldquo;well-spoken&rdquo; without surprising others with your ability to speak. If you grew up with white privilege, you didn&rsquo;t have to learn the sad reality of systematic racism. Even when we talk about white privilege, we think about different tragedies that occurred. We think about the Titanic sinking and they say, &ldquo;Never forget the Titanic!&rdquo; Or we think about the Twin Towers falling and they say, &ldquo;Never forget 9/11!&rdquo; Or when they talk about the wars our country has fought there are only white soldiers depicted &ndash; as if there were never any Black soldiers in the wars &ndash; and they say, &ldquo;Never forget the war and the lives lost!&rdquo; But then we look at slavery and you don&rsquo;t hear, &ldquo;Never forget slavery!&rdquo; Instead, we always hear, &ldquo;Get over it!&rdquo; or &ldquo;That was a long time ago, haven&rsquo;t we moved on?&rdquo; It is a privilege or even beyond privilege to erase the atrocity and tragedy of slavery as just something in the past to &ldquo;get over.&rdquo; White privilege means you don&#39;t have to explain why cultural appropriation is wrong. How about Cinco de Mayo parties where people dress up as individuals from Hispanic cultures just to drink margaritas and eat tacos. Or rap parties where people dress up like their favorite artist and wear Blackface. Again, not a good idea. You don&#39;t see Black people dressing up like white people to have a party. Yeah, you do see that in the movie <em>White Chicks</em>, which is one of my favorite movies because it&#39;s hilarious. We all know everyone&rsquo;s favorite part is, &ldquo;Making my way downtown&hellip;&rdquo; But, it really doesn&rsquo;t happen that way except in a comedy movie. I know a lot of fraternities and sororities have Fiesta Night and students dress up like a Mexican &ndash; or what they stereotype a Mexican to be. That&rsquo;s a problem! We&rsquo;re going to have a Hood Party and everybody dresses up in Blackface, baggy clothes, and act like gangsters. That&rsquo;s a problem! Or think about Halloween and how you would feel if your culture becomes a costume that makes a mockery out of your heritage, especially when they are embodying harmful stereotypes. That&rsquo;s a problem! We have to be able to call those things out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever there&#39;s a question about Black culture, I&#39;m always the first person everyone looks at, especially when it has to do with hair, skin tone, or clothes. Everybody, not only when I was in school, but throughout my life, always looked to me as if I had all the answers. They would ask, &ldquo;Justin, can you tell us why Black people do this?&rdquo; My reply, &ldquo;Yes, as the official spokesperson of all Black people in the world, I have concluded&hellip;&rdquo; NO! It doesn&rsquo;t work like that! Everybody is different. My skin color does not determine what I do and do not know &ndash; it&rsquo;s all subjective. For my student affairs professionals, this really gets tiresome. It&rsquo;s emotionally and physically draining having to always answer all these questions as a representative of my skin color. It&rsquo;s very easy for you to come to us and ask the questions, but it is also just as easy for you to do the research on your own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you&rsquo;re white, no one asks you how you really got that job, got into that school, or got that opportunity. As soon as I walk in, people say, &ldquo;Wow! How did you land this?&rdquo; Looking back at my job interviews in the past, I remember changing my voice on phone interviews. Think I&rsquo;m crazy if you want, but people judge you by your name and try to identify you by your voice. If you have a Black name and &ldquo;sound&rdquo; Black on the phone, people make conclusions about you. I still remember the looks on people&rsquo;s faces when I showed up in person after a successful phone interview, only for them to find out that I was a man of color. Priceless!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; White privilege means you never have to worry about something being called &ldquo;white-on-white&rdquo; crime. That term doesn&rsquo;t exist even though there are more white deaths by white hands than there are Black deaths by Black hands. Because Blacks only make up 13.3% of the nation&rsquo;s population, statistically, there are more deaths by white men, yet it&#39;s not called white-on-white crime. It&rsquo;s just called crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to get an inside view of this white privilege thing when my white friends went off to college and they would tell me how racist people were. My friends would say, &ldquo;Well, I think they just assumed I would get it because I was white.&rdquo; One of my white friends I grew up with said when he was at school walking down the street, a bunch of Black college students were out in the quad playing really loud music. He remembered this white guy looked him straight in his face and said, &ldquo;Hey man! Niggers, right?&rdquo; He said he looked at the guy and said, &ldquo;NO! Why are you saying this to me? That is terrible! I can&#39;t believe you said that to me!&rdquo; The guy replied, &ldquo;Well, they&#39;re all like that, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; And my friend said again, &ldquo;NO! They are not!&rdquo; My friend didn&rsquo;t understand because in the community we grew up in, we were taught that wasn&rsquo;t how to treat others. Then he went out into another community, and because of the color of his skin, someone assumed he supported a particular ideology that he did not. You have to recognize, we all use stereotypes all the time, without even knowing it. The enemy of equality is us &ndash; it&#39;s not other individuals. Take your finger and point at yourself, we are ALL responsible. It wasn&rsquo;t until my friends had their own experiences that they then realized that there are a lot of racist white people in our world. They asked me, &ldquo;How often do you have to deal with this?&rdquo; I had to look them right in the eye and tell them, &ldquo;EVERYDAY!&rdquo; and they couldn&rsquo;t believe it. We have got to stop labeling people. At one point in time, the world&rsquo;s best rapper was white, the world&rsquo;s best golfer was Black, and the tallest man in the NBA was Asian. We have got to get out of these stereotypes and we have got to be able to really look at things for what they are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, I want to reiterate that I do not think that all racist are white nor that all white people have the same level of privilege. We also have to look at all of a person&rsquo;s identities and how they intersect. Intersectionality is the interconnection of all different identities &ndash; race, religion, sexual orientation, language, ethnicity, ability, and so on. All of these identities play a role in who you are. Yes, some can be more predominant. Yes, some can award you privilege. But some are minority identities as well. Just because a person is white, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they have all the privilege out there. What if they were a trans woman? Or a white Jewish man with a disability? Or, a woman in and of itself? Each of these identities come with experiences and voices that need to be heard and valued. Each of these identities make up who we are, and some come with privilege. But we have to remember that identity isn&rsquo;t just skin deep, it is a vast intersecting and complex thing that makes us who we are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This part of the book goes out to all white people who actually get it! All the white people who take the time to really get to know the cultures, to understand the plight of people of color and minorities. The people who actually march with us, people who lend their hand, lend their privilege to help assist, the advocates and allies, and those who actually want to help us. The struggle is not over! Some people recognize their privilege and actually use it to help. It&rsquo;s an invisible, weightless backpack. But everybody carries this thing of privilege whether you have a lot of it or just a little. We have to explore white privilege. If you&rsquo;re white, take a second, have you ever thought about your privilege? Do you benefit from it? Does your privilege inhibit other people from moving forward? We have to start unpacking this invisible backpack called white privilege. Some people may read this chapter and get immediately offended. &ldquo;Justin, this is an anti-white chapter! How can you say these things?&rdquo; I want to remind to the reader that I am not anti-white. I&rsquo;m about the progression of everyone. We have to call out our present system and make strides for a better one because being pro-Black doesn&rsquo;t mean being anti-white!</p>', '2020-05-29 13:28:01', '2020-05-29 13:28:01', NULL);

(6, 14, '5', '<p>Cultural perceptions are defined by many different methods. They are created by media, entertainment, and other forms of popular culture. They really play a significant role in how we view other backgrounds, how we make decisions about what others think, and shapes our outlook. As we talked about in the previous chapter, perceptions shape how we understand stereotypes and contributes to our marginalization of others. We all have issues with perception. Perception can be formed by many things and is based off of many realities. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s how we as human see the world; our reality is our perception. But if we see, hear, and say the same things, would our perceptions be the same or different? Let&#39;s try a test. Below, I have a sentence for you to read out loud. Really, read it out loud. Go!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Funky Frogs are the result of years of scientific research contrasted with the study of years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you read it out loud? Do it again! One more time! Now, I need you to count how many F&rsquo;s you see in that sentence. Go ahead and count. There&#39;s no time limit; go ahead and count how many F&#39;s you see in that sentence. Did you get it yet? How many did you count? Did you count three? Did you count four? Did you count five? Well, if you counted six, you would be correct. For those who didn&rsquo;t count six, what happened? Was it just your perception? Was it because you went only off what you saw, not what you spoke? And that&rsquo;s the thing with perceptions. Perceptions can really just change the tiniest facet about how we understand concepts. I remember a couple years ago there was a huge controversy about a dress&rsquo;s color; was it blue and black, or was it white and gold? People were staying up late at night trying to figure this out while others actually went to the store to see for themselves. People were arguing that someone was altering the image to mess with people on social media. Scientists were telling us it is due to the retinal cones in your eyes that let light in. It all has to do with perception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perception can look like many different things. For example in the US, crickets are considered pests &ndash; dirty and annoying. You would be annoyed if you heard crickets chirping all night in your house. However, in northern Thailand, they&#39;re actually considered an appetizer or delicacy. I often think about women in the United States who look at women of the Middle East and think &ldquo;Everything&#39;s covered but her eyes; what a cruel male dominated culture.&rdquo; And then the women in the Middle East may be thinking American women have &ldquo;Nothing covered but her eyes because she has sunglasses on, what a cruel male dominated culture.&rdquo; They&#39;re both thinking the same thing, but their perception is very different, and again perception changes how we think about the world. It also depicts how we move through life and how we really gain an understanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same regards as perception, we have to look at culture. Culture is learned, and shared. It&rsquo;s unconscious, dynamic, and ethnocentric meanings are often influenced by our cultural lenses. So where do you get your cultural lenses from? Do you get it from what you&#39;re taught &ndash; what you learned in school? Do you get it based upon what you have read? I feel like sometimes individuals would rather have a reassuring lie than an inconvenient truth. For example, you would be surprised at the amount of schools that I travel to where individuals still think that Thanksgiving happened the way that they were taught in school. Yeah that&#39;s right. There are a lot of people who think that in 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue and landed in what is today the United States. We all know, historically, he found this land by accident and that he and his people couldn&#39;t survive here. The indigenous people, who already thrived here, helped them cultivate the land and they all had a giant feast for Thanksgiving. That&#39;s what a lot of students still perceive to be true. It&#39;s not in their mind that these individual&rsquo;s stole that land, raped, murdered, and pillaged entire villages just to declare them their own. We even sing songs about them. And didn&rsquo;t you know, celebrating Columbus Day means you can get 30% off your mattress!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These concepts are very difficult sometimes when we think about them on the surface. Let&rsquo;s compare this to an iceberg &ndash; you know icebergs are much bigger at the base and only show a small portion on the surface. This is similar to people, we see the surface. We see skin color, language, food, and clothing. Because that is all we see on the surface, that is how we develop our perception of different cultures. But, let&rsquo;s not forget everything underneath the surface that supports these different cultures &ndash; values, perceptions, cultural and social norms, communication styles, and so much more. These beliefs are the foundation to what is on the surface that we can see. You&#39;d be surprised at the amount of schools that I spoke at where individuals didn&#39;t think that Thanksgiving actually happened that way. You&#39;d be surprised at how many people think the Holocaust didn&#39;t happen. There are students that have been taught that the Holocaust was just a distraction during the war, to take different countries off of their game; not necessarily an actual historical turning point for Jewish people in Germany. Really? I am amazed at the faces of students when I tell them that in Germany, people knew what was going on &ndash; people saw their Jewish neighbors being dragged out of their houses and killed. Some of them even robbed their neighbors when their houses were abandoned. How can you think that these historical atrocities did not happen?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I often think about this one professor of mine who asked me, &ldquo;Justin, why do all the Black students sit in the back of a class? How come they never sit up in the front? You sit in the front.&rdquo; I really had to think about it because again, sometimes individuals want to make you the spokesperson for the entire race. I asked my professor, &ldquo;Do you think your students of color feel comfortable sitting in the front?&rdquo; My professor had a puzzled look on his face and said &ldquo;Well I&#39;m not sure about that.&rdquo; I then said, &ldquo;You should ask them what they think because sometimes our students, especially our students of a color feel safer to sit in a place where they can find their strength. Because strength in numbers is where their strength emanates from.&rdquo; So if you see a group of students hanging out in a particular section, ask them why is that? Is it because they don&#39;t feel that comfortable in the majority or do they feel that they would not be welcomed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all know the beliefs are drawn from our own culture&rsquo;s view of reality. To understand culture you have to look at it through the lens of individual beliefs in order to examine what these beliefs have already created. If you perceive things that may be incorrect from other cultures through your own cultural lens, you may be seeing people through a different set of eyes. I often think about offices of cultural awareness or multicultural affairs at universities. When I go and speak to the directors of those offices, they always say to me, &ldquo;You know Justin, people always think that our office is the Black office, we never get students who are white to come to our office, why is that?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s almost the same thing in reverse of what I just explained. Do you think that your white students would feel comfortable coming to this office? Do you make it welcoming for everybody to come to this office? What are their perceptions and beliefs of this office? These things have to change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s the difference between intentionality versus the intention. And sometimes we have to change our own perception for ourselves. For example, as a Black male, when I&#39;m walking into a store, I make sure that I smile. I make sure that the clerk sees who I am. I seem like I&#39;m friendly and I&rsquo;m not present to create trouble. That&rsquo;s not the same way I have to be when I go into the city. I don&#39;t have to go around and shake hands and pretend like I&#39;m something that I&#39;m not. If anything, it&rsquo;s the exact opposite when I&#39;m walking through the city. I don&#39;t smile at anybody and don&rsquo;t say hello to anybody. Why? Because you have to show them that you&#39;re tough. You may have to put on a mean grit or they&#39;ll think that you&#39;re soft. Being soft in the city can sometimes be a dangerous thing. So as a Black man I have to constantly change who I am to adapt to my surroundings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So perception is received differently from person to person. But I still get the same old thing when I travel. I often hear people say, we have to give money to Africa because they are poor. That&rsquo;s a very false perception. There are a lot of rich people and rich areas in Africa. Did you know Africa has blue water beaches? Look it up. There are poor areas in Africa just like the poor areas of the United States. So when people say we have to give to the poor over there, I ask why we don&rsquo;t give to the poor here. It&#39;s making these perceptions that are incorrect. I remember I had a false perception about celebrities at one point. At the beginning of this book, I told you I met close to 300 celebrities in my lifetime. I had false perception that celebrities were greater than life, not down to earth, or that they were untouchable. It wasn&#39;t until I met the late Dr. Maya Angelou that I learned my perceptions were completely incorrect. I remember Dr. Angelou came to visit Slippery Rock University and I was given the very special opportunity to meet her backstage. I sat there role playing what I was going to say to this woman. I mean, she was a huge icon in my community. My mother owned her books and I remember hearing about her struggles, courage, and insight growing up. I knew I only had a brief amount of time and I didn&#39;t want to embarrass myself, so I remember just sitting there contemplating what I was going to say. I rehearsed my lines: &ldquo;Good evening Dr. Angelou&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dr. Maya Angelou, how are you, nice to meet you.&rdquo; Or should I go more casual with a &ldquo;What&#39;s up Dr. A?&rdquo; No matter what I came up with I didn&#39;t think anything was good. I decided that when I met her, I was going to wing it. So I got behind stage and Dr. Angelou was there and, fortunately, I was the first person to meet her. I was so nervous because everybody was standing around watching me. I don&#39;t know why I did this but when I went up to her, she extended her hand to me. I grabbed her hand, bowed and said &ldquo;Nice to meet you.&rdquo; Dr. Angelou looked me straight in the eye and said, &ldquo;Honey child, the only person you bow to is the great one.&rdquo; and she pointed up as if referring to God. That was a really big day for me to really learn about perception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can&#39;t go off what people tell you. People want you to accept their beliefs based off of their perceptions and experiences. But, your experiences can be the complete opposite. I always think it&#39;s interesting when I&#39;m talking to people who are not of color and they&#39;re say something like, &ldquo;You know Black people are still holding on to the slavery thing, like I was never a slave owner, why should I be responsible for this?&rdquo; or &ldquo;You know it was my great-great grandfather who did this not me, we should start over.&rdquo; I think it&rsquo;s unfair for people to tell Black folk they need to get over something when people are still walking around with Confederate flags chanting &ldquo;Never forget the south.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s think about it this way. Black people are asked to get over slavery so the nation can move on. Yet, we have people in the country holding on to a symbol from a war they lost over the right to own slaves. It truly makes you question which group is the one that needs to move on. And I can tell you, the answer is not Black people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to be able to make sure that our perception is equal. We need to meet each other on an equal playing field so that our realities can almost sync up. For example, I can&rsquo;t understand why Flint, MI still doesn&#39;t have clean water and I don&#39;t know why we&#39;re not talking about it. We&rsquo;ll spend millions and millions of hours talking about the Kardashians or what Donald Trump just did, but yet, there are people in this country who still don&#39;t have clean water. I want you to imagine that for a second. We take so many things for granted, especially here in the US. Imagine waking up and trying to wash your face, you turn on the water, and out comes a sludgy brown substance. Could you survive that way? Could you live that way? Would you complain? Would you be upset? These people have been living like this for over a year and nothing&#39;s been changed. I don&#39;t understand how we could pay 15 billion dollars for a wall to divide the continent, but don&#39;t have 55 million to provide clean water to our citizens. That doesn&#39;t make any sense to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This conversation always brings up taxes and what our taxes are used for. I am happy to say that I agree with how some of our tax dollars are being used. I think a lot of people out there like NPR and PBS because it provides us with the opportunity to learn and entertainment. These entities take $1.37 out of your taxes to be funded each year. Well guess what, take my $1.37 &ndash; I love NPR and PBS. I will gladly pay taxes for service they provide. Also, $.11 out of my taxes go to developing minority businesses and $.66 for entrepreneurship and innovation. They can absolutely take $.48 so they can fund civil rights division of the US Department of Justice. If we&#39;re going to be able to defend the planet Earth, give them that $1.38. If they need $9.00 to install safeguards for our climate, take it! I added up all of those costs they&#39;re only taking $22.36 out of my paycheck to fund these things a year. Look if all it takes is $23.00 a year to for us to make America great again, wouldn&rsquo;t it be worth it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So little of our tax dollars are going to things that will protect our planet, both the people and the earth itself. Barely anything goes to the Corporation of Public Broadcasting that help fund PBS and NPR &ndash; entities that educate and connect us to the world around us. So where is all the money going? Is America greedy? Is America privileged? Is America too privileged? Like you said, some people say it&#39;s a melting pot. I don&#39;t think so &ndash; I think it&#39;s like a salad with blends with different shapes, textures, and flavors. But back to America. America is supposed to be the land of free and the home of the brave. Are we really free, or are we chained up by our own perceptions of how things should be? Are we stuck in the past or stuck accepting the truths of others. Are we brave enough stand up for others or what we believe in? Can you imagine being in a place without some of the freedoms we take for granted on a daily basis? Even the mere idea of thinking differently than the dominant culture is a death sentence in some places. Yet, we have this ability and we remain silent. We do not correct the negative perceptions. We don&#39;t fix the things that need to be fixed. We argue about that $.48 each a year to fund a department for civil rights is a waste of taxpayer money. But, there are people in so many places that want nothing more than the opportunity and the ability to call America their home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&#39;s think about the privilege we have here in America. It&#39;s hard to argue that we don&#39;t have more opportunities and access than many other places throughout the world. But with this, we need to talk about the greed we also have. I think to all these nonprofits and organizations doing things like &quot;Saving Africa.&quot; Broadcasting their TV ads about how a $1.00 day could save a child&#39;s life. But, where is all that money going? Organizations are collecting this money, but where are the outcomes? Not too long ago, Akon, a popular rap artist, used his own money to provide electricity to over fifty million Africans. Where were those organizations then? Let&#39;s also think about how we funnel money to these organizations to &quot;save&quot; Black children in Africa, while we sit here in America and allow Black kids to get shot in parks. Of course, I&#39;m not saying to stop donating money to good causes that help those in need around the country. But why are we sending money to save a Black kid in Africa when we can&#39;t stand up and speak out for the Black kid shot playing with his friends in Ohio? Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll get into this more in the next chapter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To wrap up the conversation on perception, we must think of how we are going to move forward. We must reflect on what our perceptions are and how we overcome these to move on for the betterment of society. We&rsquo;ve got to have some effective cross cultural communication. In order to accomplish that, we have to do a few things. We have to build self-awareness. You do this by going to events, researching, learning, and supporting your friends when they&#39;re having cultural conversations. We&rsquo;ve got to recognize the complexity. You&#39;re not going to be able to understand people&#39;s culture overnight. You might not even be able to understand it throughout the course of your lifetime, but you have to try. You&rsquo;ve got to avoid stereotyping. Stereotypes do nothing but separate us. Even if they are so extreme and almost become comical, they are still harmful. Some stereotypes can give us some insight, but they&#39;re not an absolute. We&#39;ve got to be able to respect others differences. At the end of the day, I don&#39;t have to agree with you but I should respect your opinion and you should respect mine as well. No opinions are wrong that&#39;s why it&#39;s called an opinion. We need to listen actively. God gave us two ears, two nostrils, and two eyes, but one mouth. There is significance in that. We need to be honest and ask questions. If you don&#39;t know, ask. I repeat, if you don&#39;t know, ask. That&#39;s how you gain the knowledge, but you also have to be honest when you&#39;re wrong. It&rsquo;s perfectly fine to say, &ldquo;Hey, I don&#39;t know about this, could you tell me more about this?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hey, I wasn&#39;t sure why I saw you do this, can you give me some more insight?&rdquo; We have to be flexible, but know that it&#39;s not always going to go your way. I&#39;m sorry, but readers, it&#39;s not always about YOU! So we&#39;ve got to be able to think twice when we&#39;re having these misconceptions. We have to distinguish the perspectives. What do you know to be true, what do you know to be false, and how does what you know compare to what someone else knows?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think one of the more important games that I&rsquo;ve ever played in D.A.P. (Diversity Awareness Program) was a game called <em>The Pain Game.</em> I played this activity during Black History Month and there were about 120 students in attendance that evening. I asked people, &ldquo;could you relate to the pain that slaves had experienced?&rdquo; The individuals that were in the room all said, &ldquo;Oh no Justin...of course not. I could never be able to recreate that pain. I mean they were being taken away from their families, having their entire cultures and identities stripped from them, killed, raped, berated, and mocked.&rdquo; &ldquo;There&#39;s no way that we could possibly recreate their pain.&rdquo; But I said, &ldquo;Despite what pain it may be, pain is pain.&rdquo; That is something that everyone experiences and it is something that connects all people. We talk about aspects that bring us together and our differences, but we never talk about pain. Next, I have students anonymously write their innermost pain or fear on a piece of paper and place them in a bag. I shuffled this up and read some notes out loud. Some of those papers were really noteworthy and I think what was most impactful was the processing that took place after the notes were written. Some of the fears included: I used to think all Black people were bad until one saved my life; I currently have cancer; Me and my best friend had a falling out and we&#39;ve yet to get it together and I see my best friend every day; I constantly steal because I&#39;m homeless; I&rsquo;m in college because my parents are forcing me too...I don&#39;t know what to do; My parents are divorcing and they&#39;re not thinking about their children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These small pieces of paper give a glimpse into the hearts of the people in the audience. A room where no one knows each other instantly turns into a productive group counseling session. As I read those notes out loud, I saw people starting to give people hugs, hold hands, show faces of concern, and ultimately show their humanness compassion for others. Sure, some people are probably sitting there asking to themselves where did this come from or who is it this person? It even goes through my head when I do these activities. People are putting their life&rsquo;s deepest darkest fears, pains, and secrets on a piece of paper and having them read aloud. It can definitely bring up some type of emotion and evoke some type of reaction. It&rsquo;s interesting to see the commonality of these fears and pains. A lot of them happen to be about poor relationships and how they recovered from them. It is good to know that even with your darkest pain, you are not alone. That someone else is going through something similar and has survived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father always talks about how people who have been hurt end up hurting people. That sometimes you really can&#39;t fault people for hurting you because that is all they know. Some people do it intentionally, some people do it unintentionally, but it still happens. People can only meet you as far as they&#39;ve met themselves. You can&rsquo;t expect people to do something outside of the norm of what they already know. Again, I can only speak from <em>my</em> Christian perspective, and I understand that not everybody reading the book is a Christian, but a lot of these notes were about the church. They totally killed me to hear the pain that a church caused to them. One especially stands out to me to this day. It read &ldquo;I was very welcome in my church until they found out that I was gay.&rdquo; And that&#39;s a problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we talk about perceptions, again, we talk about what is right and what is wrong because perceptions can have a right way and they can have a wrong way. For example, today people say don&#39;t break the law, I mean they probably always said that, but have been some big exceptions; in the past, there were a lot of laws that were broken. If you sheltered Jews over in Germany, you were breaking the law even though you were saving them from the Holocaust. The Underground Railroad included a lot of individuals who decided to break the law. Harriet Tubman broke the law. Rosa Parks broke the law. If you really want to talk about the creation of our country, the Boston Tea Party broke the law. I think it all depends on how you&#39;re looking at a situation. Why did these individuals risk their lives, livelihood, families, reputation, and their futures just to break the law? Was there something within the perception that had to change? Was it worth going through such extreme means to ensure that individuals were treated fairly and that people&#39;s basic civil liberties were upheld? Sometimes when I am at the gym, I see people making fun of bigger people working out. I don&#39;t understand that. They talk about them and shame them. You should be happy that people want to better themselves. Making fun of someone who&#39;s a little bigger at the gym is like making fun of a cancer patient who&#39;s getting chemotherapy. If individuals are doing something to make them healthier or feel better, why do some think it&rsquo;s good idea to shame them? We can always go back to the age old proverb, &ldquo;If you don&#39;t have anything nice to say don&#39;t say anything at all.&rdquo; But we don&rsquo;t live like that. We live in a society where we have the First Amendment and the right to free speech. Therefore, we have the right to say whatever we want whenever we want. No, I don&rsquo;t think so. I think that people hide behind that. Even though you have the right to say whatever you want you also have to be held accountable for the things that you say.</p>', '2020-05-29 13:28:46', '2020-05-29 13:28:46', NULL);

(7, 15, '6', '<p>Black lives matter or do they? Man, this movement, this call to action, this Black Live Matter thing has truly thrown our society, our nation, our world into global sensitivity. What does Black Lives Matter truly really mean? Does it mean that only Black lives matter? Does it mean that Black lives matter and white lives don&#39;t? Is it a hate group? Is it a movement that wants to destroy white power? We could try to take a look at what the media says surrounding this so-called Black Lives Matter, but I&#39;m not sure if we would get much from that view? I have to ask myself what I think about people like me &ndash; Tameer Rice, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, and Sandra Bland just to name a few, do we matter? What about their families? How do they feel about the situation, and grieve? How do they consistently turn on their TV and have to be reminded about it with every media coverage about another slain person of color. And what about me, the author? Today, I could be a public speaker, tomorrow I could be a doctor, but the next day, I could be another hashtag on social media. Does my life matter? Does the life of my future son matter?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these questions are really puzzling to me especially when I think about my own experiences in my life. I remember my parents talking to me about college ever since I was a kid. I remember walking to my grandma&#39;s house and her asking me &ldquo;Hey Justin, do you want to go to college one day?&rdquo; and I told her no because I hated school. I remember my grandmother conveniently going into a cabinet and pulling out an old assignment that my uncle completed when he was my age. The assignment asked him what he did this summer and he said nothing. It asked how many books he read? He said not one darn book. I remember my grandma looking at me and telling me, &ldquo;You know your uncle also hated school at one time and he went on to get his doctoral degree.&rdquo; And literally, twenty years later, I was graduating with my master&rsquo;s degree with hopes to get started on a Ph.D.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I also remember in ninth grade where everybody went to go meet the school counselor. My counselor called me in and said she wanted to learn more about me. She wanted to get an idea of how I was doing academically and to see what my future plans were post high school. I told her that I wanted to go to college and study Psychology. My school counselor looked me right in the face and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking at your grades right now and it doesn&#39;t seem like you&rsquo;re college material.&nbsp; Perhaps you want to pick up a trade or a skill. That&#39;s going to be really beneficial for you. Maybe cutting hair, doing masonry, or working on cars. That might be really useful for you in the future.&rdquo; I remember looking at her and saying no, and that I would be going to college. She said that with my grades, it doesn&#39;t look like I would get there. Boy was she wrong! This story reminds me of how many Black youth are treated this way in America. They&rsquo;re told that they can&#39;t do it. They get robbed of their self-esteem and are told that they&#39;re not good enough. They are shown that their ambitions aren&#39;t so important, and maybe, because of the color of their skin, they are unfit to achieve their dreams. All I have to say is if your dreams aren&#39;t scary enough then you&#39;re probably not dreaming big enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going back to the main subject, the way Blacks are treated in America is completely unacceptable. It&#39;s not always white people who are attacking people of color. People of color attack people of color. With that being said, how many of you would actually like to be treated like Blacks are treated in America? I&rsquo;ll wait while you answer that question...I didn&#39;t think so. That&#39;s why the Black Lives Matter is a call to action. Let&rsquo;s look at the Black Lives Matter versus All Lives Matter because it is such an interesting concept. Is All Lives Matter essentially saying that everyone matters while Black Lives Matter is saying <em>only </em>Black lives matter? No, I don&#39;t think so. Who in their right mind would say only Black lives matter? That doesn&#39;t make sense. Of course, all lives matter! My question is where was All Lives Matter during slavery? Where was All Lives Matter during the women&rsquo;s suffrage movement in the twenties? Where was All Lives Matter when there were Japanese internment camps during WWII? Where was All Lives Matter when the LGBTQIA community were fighting for the right to marry? Where is All Lives Matter now when Syrians are seeking refuge in our country? Where is All Lives Matter during any of these battles? Those individuals always seem to be quiet during these times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People say that Black Lives Matter is a hate group. They riot, they destroy, they are violent, and they&rsquo;re like the Black Panthers. Well the interesting thing about the Black Panthers is, the Black Panthers were a group that was designed to be non-violent. They were a group that was designed to <em>police</em> the police because the police were taking the law into their own hands; the police were completely being prejudiced against those who were of color. You never heard of the Black Panthers going out and shooting and killing someone. That&#39;s not what the group was about. Yet, the KKK, a nationally recognized hate group, is known for and boasts about hanging people of color, killing Jews, and destroying people of a different sexual orientation, but we don&#39;t call those groups terroristic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;m also hearing things about Blue Lives Matter in references to the police. This movement now focuses on how cops feel like they are in more danger and at risk because of prejudice against them. What&rsquo;s interesting is that when we talk about Blue Lives Matter, it doesn&#39;t mean that only cops matter and that everyone else doesn&rsquo;t matter. Blue Lives Matter says cops lives matter and they are representing their uniform. A uniform is something you wear, something you put on to represent that occupation. You can&rsquo;t compare an occupation to the color of someone&rsquo;s skin &ndash; their natural born race or ethnicity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you&#39;re really paying attention to the Black Lives Matter movement, if you&#39;re looking at that statement, there&#39;s almost an invisible <em>also</em>, or <em>too</em> at the end. So it really says Black Lives Matter Too or Black Lives Matter Also. We are just trying to bring attention to issues that are surrounding people of color. It doesn&#39;t mean any other issues are not important. We&rsquo;re just trying to bring attention to our issues. It&#39;s the media - news, internet, social networking &ndash; that makes it seem like this is an all pro&ndash;Black movement. You wouldn&rsquo;t see someone go participate in a save the rainforest campaign and say &ldquo;Yellowstone Park trees matter also.&rdquo; It wouldn&rsquo;t happen. You wouldn&rsquo;t see someone at a Relay for Life, an organization that aims towards helping those battling cancer, say &ldquo;All diseases matter.&rdquo; They wouldn&rsquo;t do that because of course all these things matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#39;s problematic for me though, as a 27 year old Black male living in a suburban, upper-middle class area, is that I remember the night that the verdict of Trayvon Martin came out. I was so angry that I went out for a run. I remember getting a call from my mom late that night, around 11:30pm. She asked me where I was and I said I was out for a run. She was upset that I was out at the time, maybe even a little scared. She asked me, at age 27, if I knew what to do if I was stopped by the police. I said, &quot;Of course I know what to do, Mom. It&#39;s the police, when they tell you to pull over, you pull over. You turn your car off, put your hands out the window, show them you&#39;re not a threat, and show them you don&rsquo;t have any weapons.&rdquo; My mom stopped me right there and said, &ldquo;No, do you know what to do when the police pull you over?&rdquo; I was so confused about what my mom was talking about. I said, &ldquo;Yeah mom, like the same thing I said.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;No that&#39;s not the time for you to show them how educated you are with your master&#39;s degree. It&#39;s not time for you to prove to them that you live in the area or that you belong on God&#39;s green earth. It&#39;s the time for you to do whatever they tell you to do so that I can see you the next day.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t understand what she was saying. My mom quietly clarified, &ldquo;Well sometimes in order to keep your life as a Black man, it means you&#39;ve got to release your dignity, it means you&#39;ve got to release your humanity, it means you have to forego your entirety as a human being. If they want to spit on your soul, you let them because that allows me to be able to keep you as my son the next day.&rdquo; As a 27 year old man having to hear my mom tell me that just really broke my heart. My mom would rather me go through full humiliation as a person so that she could see me again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s look at all the information on Black-on-Black crime. Black-on-Black crime is a myth. It&#39;s something that&#39;s set up by society, by newspapers, and by social media to show disaggregated information which might not even be true. You never hear something called white-on-white crime because it doesn&#39;t exist. Why is a Black-on-Black crime even a thing? Maybe it&#39;s a thing because people fear Black people. I&#39;m telling you, you have no clue how many times I&#39;m walking down the sidewalk at night, by myself, and I see a white couple walking towards me. They completely jump off the sidewalk and walk across the street so they don&#39;t have to walk by me &ndash; and I&rsquo;m a teddy bear. There is a true fear of people of color in this country. Is this fear based off of things they see on TV, read in the newspaper, or stories they heard? I have never personally done anything to anybody that would make me scary, so why just run away from me? I can tell you, I&#39;ve been in elevators where women will clinch onto their purses and shift away from me. It&rsquo;s a very shameful feeling to know that people have these preconceived notions about you before they even get a chance to know you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen this struggle of Black people my whole life. Most people usually hear &quot;the United States of America...the land of the free.&quot; But this place is also called &quot;AmeriKKKa,&rdquo; where people of color are killed for walking down their own street. Shot for holding their wallet when they get pulled over by police. We have Black men being sent to jail for crimes they didn&#39;t commit, but are presumed guilty because of the color of their skin. I have friends that are in prison over outrageous and outlandish charges. Skin color is not a reasonable suspicion. But Blacks, still in their best way, most of them maybe, not all of them, try their best to follow the rules. We are just like every other race of people, some good eggs, and some bad ones. We try to fit in. We try to take place in the marches. We try to make sure that we do whatever we need to do. So it seems like Black people do fit in, or at least try to. But in America, that&rsquo;s not really in our favor sometimes. We&#39;re living lives that people can&rsquo;t fathom in their scariest nightmares, yet we&#39;re supposed to fit in, fall in line, and do what we have to do. I can&#39;t begin to tell you how many times I&#39;ve seen people say go back to Africa or go back where you came from. In America, if everybody was forced to go back to where they came from, there would barely be anyone left! Let&rsquo;s not forget that a lot of Americans are multicultural too, where would you go? Half of you to Ireland and the other half to Italy? A quarter to Thailand, a quarter to Mexico, a quarter to Armenia, and a quarter to Nepal? How does someone tell a Black person to go back to Africa if you&rsquo;re not willing to go back to where you or ancestors came from?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes when I&#39;m driving through Pennsylvania, I have to go through places called sundown towns &ndash; places that were historically dangerous for Blacks when the sun went down &ndash; and it&rsquo;s truly terrible. Honestly, you also don&rsquo;t want to be Black going through those towns when the sun is up either. To my readers, I don&#39;t know what your background is but there are some places that when the sun goes down you&#39;re still okay. You can still walk the streets. You can still drive through and everything will be fine. I know for me, there are just some places that when the sun has gone down, you will not catch me there. I try to get gas before I drive through out of fear that someone&#39;s going to stop and ask me why I&#39;m there or that police will pull me over for just being there. You may run into someone that will want to do a mandatory search or if I go to a place to get food or gas, they can just refuse to serve me and not even tell you why. These are areas that keep me scared. These places were really prevalent in the south but they still exist today. They exists everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, to be relatively conscious and Black means to always be angry. It&rsquo;s strange because if you&#39;re &ldquo;woke&rdquo; as they say, you can really get sucked into what that truly means. You would be angry all the time because of the injustices that you are constantly facing. The constant battle that you have to fight every day to prove that you&#39;re supposed to be a part of this great nation. That you&#39;re worthy of your degrees, that you&#39;re allowed to be in the same classes as other people, and that you earned that job. There are times I felt I had to keep quiet. That being quiet was the best way for me to be able to get through and survive. Keep your head down, say nothing, and do what you gotta do. No matter if I was outspoken or I was quiet, I went through the same experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just look at individuals like Tameer Rice &ndash; a twelve-year-old kid who was shot because he had a BB gun in a park. I asked a lot of my friends, who just happened to be white, when they had gotten a BB gun? They got one when they were eight, maybe nine years old. I asked them if they ever played with the gun in the park. For them, that was a common place or out in the woods. I can&#39;t imagine any cops shooting them down. What kind of training takes place where cops, several cops, have to kill a twelve-year-old over a BB gun? There was no communication. There was no get on the ground. There was nothing. Shoot first, ask questions later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to laugh when my dad asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I would tell my dad I want to work and be a Psychologist. My dad would say, &ldquo;Wouldn&#39;t you want to be president one day?&rdquo; I would just laugh because at that point in my life I hadn&rsquo;t seen anybody who looked like me as a President of the United States. In fact, they made a very funny movie about that in 2004 called <em>Head of State</em> starring the famous comedian Chris Rock. He depicted how it would be in America if a Black man ran for president and he won at the end. A very comical movie, but the movie was made because no one in their right mind would ever picture that a Black man would be Commander-in-Chief or leader of the free world. It wasn&rsquo;t until 2008 when Barack Obama was elected President of the United States, that maybe, we as a people were able to come up. Maybe those dreams and aspirations weren&rsquo;t too big, maybe we had broken through the glass ceiling. I remember everyone being excited, including me, on election night. &ldquo;Man, he did it! Man, this country&#39;s going to be different. Man, we&#39;re really going to come up after that.&rdquo; Then I think about our reality, we elected a president that we did not allow to do a thing. Sometimes, the only thing that we allowed Obama to do was to break the color barrier. His hands were tied during his entire presidency. We moaned. We complained. We held him up. People talk about all the great things that Obama did, and I agree I think he did marvelous things. The things that keep me up at night, is what else could he have done? What barriers could he have broken down? How much farther could we have been as a nation if we truly just allowed him to do the things that he needed to do? Now, because I&#39;m saying that doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m pro-Obama. I&#39;m just saying that facts are facts. When people are talking about opinions and they say, oh well he did this and he did that. However you feel about a candidate it doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is the outcome &ndash; all that was achieved to better our country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So right now, in this current time, we have Donald Trump as our president. I&rsquo;m not saying I&#39;m for Trump, not saying I&rsquo;m against Trump. You should never be against your Commander-in-Chief. That&#39;s like being against your own airplane pilot. Some people don&rsquo;t like the pilot. Well guess what, we&#39;re all on this plane right and we need to get there together. So, regardless of if you like your pilot or not, you need to support him so we can make sure that we get to where we need to be. I remember my father always telling me I could be the President of the United States and me just laughing about it. I never realized that it was something I could actually accomplish until 2008. But think to yourself, how many things have you been able to accomplish that you thought were impossible?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there things out there that you would like to do that you haven&rsquo;t? Don&rsquo;t have dreams, have plans! What are your plans and aspirations and are you truly working up to your fullest potential to meet them? I never thought that I would have two businesses. I would never have thought that I&#39;d be writing a book. There have been a lot of setbacks in my life, but failure only comes when growth is right around the corner. You can&rsquo;t expect to grow without having a little bit of failure in your life. Do you expect everything in your life to work out fine? That&#39;s simply not going to happen because life doesn&#39;t work out that way. It&#39;s always a roll of the dice and you have to play the hand that you&rsquo;ve been dealt. Look, at one point in my life, my life could have been described as Jason Peele&rsquo;s horror film, <em>Get Out</em>. But that&rsquo;s another story, for another book, at another time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My biggest question about all these events that took place is whether or not actions had to be lethal. Yes, I understand the police have to report to the situations. Again, we talk about Tameer Rice, a twelve-year-old kid who was shot by the police. The police couldn&#39;t call over to him and asked if that was a toy? They couldn&rsquo;t tell him to stop, drop the gun, or toss it over to them? He was twelve, he was a child. The police didn&#39;t have enough training not to shoot and kill this kid? I think about Trayvon Martin and the George Zimmerman verdict. It doesn&#39;t matter how you feel about the verdict. I doesn&#39;t matter how you feel about George Zimmerman. We&#39;ve got to look at the facts. Facts say that when George Zimmerman called it in as a situation, he was told to not pursue this child. He should have listened to the orders of the authorities. Therefore, by not following those orders, he failed to comply. Anything he did after the fact, he should have been held accountable for. He shot and killed a child. Let&rsquo;s think about Eric Garner. A lot of people say you can&#39;t talk about Eric Garner because he was illegally selling cigarettes. You know what, that may be true but was it a crime worthy of a death sentence? That&#39;s my question to all these cases. Even if George Zimmerman had beat up Trayvon Martin, I would rather him have been beat up than shot and killed. I would rather all of these people have been beat up rather than shot and killed. My question is always, does it have to be lethal? I know that police officers have tasers but I rarely see them used. They always use the guns when it comes to us. I don&#39;t even get it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of these videos have even gone viral. I remember seeing one unarmed Black man shot almost 28 times in a video last year. Osama Bin Laden didn&rsquo;t even get shot 28 times. But, Black men are shot that many times? I don&#39;t get it. It doesn&#39;t make any sense and that&rsquo;s why people of color react the way they do. I hear people say &ldquo;All I see is Black people rioting destroying their own cities, and it&rsquo;s horrible. They should think of something more constructive to do instead of all this rioting. The rioting isn&rsquo;t doing anything.&rdquo; Okay, so Black people should have peaceful protests. When I think about peaceful protests, I think about Martin Luther King in the 60s and all those unarmed people, and what happened to them? Canines were released on them. They had hoses sprayed on them. They had their cars set on fire. So maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t have peaceful protests. Maybe Black people should just remain quiet and not say anything. Okay, so let&rsquo;s think of this past NFL season and Colin Kapernick, remember him? All he did was take a knee before a game. Look at all the controversy that was surrounding him and the criticism that he had for not putting his hand over his heart during the national anthem. This was a silent and peaceful move to bring attention to an issue. And he was a proven winner. He took his team to the Super Bowl. Yet, no one in the NFL wants to even hire him now. Now you&#39;re telling me that Black people can&#39;t riot. They can&rsquo;t speak up, they can&rsquo;t sit down, and they can&#39;t peacefully protest. What&rsquo;s left for them to do? Maybe they should wait quietly and rely on the judicial system, because it&rsquo;s innocent until proven guilty, right? Wrong! If you haven&rsquo;t seen the documentary <em>13th</em>, you should catch that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So judicial system isn&rsquo;t the answer, so what&rsquo;s left? What&#39;s left for people of color to do? Well it seems like the only thing left for us to do is accept our deaths because we can&#39;t do anything else. This makes me think of another interesting thing &ndash;America was willing to take Blacks as slaves but can&#39;t take in refugees. Yet, we are a country of immigrants, except for Native Americans, of course. It doesn&#39;t make any sense. Many people say, &ldquo;We don&#39;t want these refugees in this country. They don&#39;t deserve to be over here.&rdquo; Okay then, so how many of you, by a show of hands, would love to trade places with a refugee? I&rsquo;ll wait...I didn&#39;t think so. You can&rsquo;t tell me that if America got as bad as other places, that you wouldn&#39;t do everything in your power to get your family to safety. You would do anything to ensure that you didn&rsquo;t have to worry about them on any given night and that all of their needs were being met. You tell me you wouldn&#39;t do that for your family? That&#39;s why most European immigrants came here, but now, it&rsquo;s not okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It saddens me still whenever I walk into a room I have to prove my intelligence. It&#39;s actually quite disheartening when I tell people that I have my master&#39;s degree and instead of them saying &ldquo;Oh wow, that&#39;s great.&rdquo; they say something along the lines &ldquo;You? You&rsquo;re so young!&rdquo; Or when I&#39;m talking to parents and students and they say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to talk to an adult.&rdquo; That&#39;s always interesting as if my color defines or cancels out my age, experience, or professional training. That my color defines my knowledge and abilities. Sometimes when I walk into a room with individuals I don&#39;t know, I smile. This is to ensure that everyone&#39;s not thrown off or that no one feels like I make them uncomfortable. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever had to feel like that. What does it mean to be overly friendly for someone of color? It means to show that you&#39;re not a threat. It hurts sometimes because when it comes to issues dealing with people of color, I actually may have a say. Then again, maybe I might not. But you won&rsquo;t know until you add me as part of your <em>diverse</em> group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the way I have learned that a lot of people who look like me aren&#39;t necessarily for me. What I mean by that is, there were times when I thought that it was only people who were not of color that were out to get me and that people of color wanted to do right by me. That&rsquo;s not always the case. There are people of color who want to see you drown as well. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I have talked to Black folks and they were just completely rude to me. People saying, &ldquo;Oh you got a master&rsquo;s degree, who do you think you are?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re too good working up there at the university, huh?&rdquo; If commenting on my dedication and success isn&rsquo;t enough, I hear &ldquo;I see you traveling doing this and that.&rdquo; Haters are interesting individuals. It&rsquo;s honestly entertaining. There has to be something - some light, something special in your soul &ndash; that they are trying to squash. I want everybody to be successful. If you ask me how I did it, not only would I tell you how to do it, but I would also show you how to do it. At some point, for the haters, you have to actually appreciate them because they saw something so special inside you, something so great, that they were angry you had it and they didn&rsquo;t. There was something inside them telling them that they couldn&rsquo;t do what you were doing. Sometimes, I don&#39;t feel like the things I&#39;m doing are really all that special. Sometimes I really feel like I&#39;m just bells and whistles, but there has to be some innate gift that keeps you striving to do more and succeed beyond your initial goals or limitations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes as a Black man, I&#39;m afraid of losing my Black card &ndash; the membership to the Black community that you automatically get by just being Black. There are several ways you could lose this, like not watching the movie <em>Boyz n the Hood</em>, or not knowing how to do the Electric Slide. It wasn&rsquo;t until last year that I saw the movie <em>Friday</em>. Someone actually said &ldquo;What the heck? You&rsquo;ve never seen these movies, I&#39;m white and I&#39;ve seen these movies!&rdquo; It just wasn&rsquo;t a thing that I was interested in. Having to still have one foot in the Black community and one foot out the Black community is a very hard position to navigate. You immediately know whether you&#39;re accepted or you&#39;re not accepted depending on what area you are currently standing in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is my Blackness truly defined? Is it defined by the way I walk? Is it defined by what pair of shoes I have on my feet or if I have any ice around my neck? Is my Blackness defined by the way that I speak? Is my Blackness best identified by how my face looks on particular day? I just think that a system that was never meant for us will never be able to help us. I think back to Emmett Till, a young Black man who was horrendously and horrifically killed for allegedly whistling at a white woman. Almost 40 years later, the woman who accused him admitted that she told a lie. Have you actually seen a picture of Emmett Till? If you haven&rsquo;t, go look him up. Did this punishment meet the crime? It&#39;s heartbreaking to know how he was killed, a true horror. He was shot, he was beaten, he was stabbed, and then dragged. He was mercilessly and viciously killed. For this woman to come out in 2017 and say it was a lie is absolutely disgusting. Then, she put it in a memoir and said the memoir won&#39;t be released for another five years. Where&#39;s the justice in that? So she&#39;s going to leave the legacy of a book that everyone is going to buy. Her family will profit from this book, but still this young man will never get justice? His mother had an open casket so everyone could see the horrific and brutal acts that were happening to men of color at that time. She wanted people to see that he was unrecognizable. People said that they could smell his body from one side of town to the other, but still there was no justice. None!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So where do we feel safe as Black people? Where&rsquo;s our safe space? Where is our area to go so that we don&rsquo;t have to go through the violence or the prejudice of racism? Is it in our own homes? Is it within our own families? Do we come out with Black owned businesses run by Black employees from Black CEOs? Do we funnel money into our own financial system? Some people think that that&#39;s the way that we should go. Some people think that we need to learn how to function within the areas in which we&#39;re given. Others think that we should be happy that we were brought over here, and now due to the Emancipation Proclamation, we&#39;re all free. We should be able to all go out there and make a living for ourselves and be able to make the best out of what we can get. My suggestion is that we need to all learn how to coexist. There are going to be people of color, people from different religions, sexual orientations, backgrounds, languages, socioeconomic statuses, educational levels, and abilities. We need to be able to figure out how we can all exist in this global marketplace and become global citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we do here in America definitely has an effect on what happens around the world. We don&#39;t need to feel isolated. We don&#39;t need to feel alone, even though at times we do. As a Black man I can tell you that there are times I absolutely feel isolated and feel alone, like nobody cares and no one wants you. Sometimes, it feels like everybody wants to see you fail and never to succeed. That anything that you say has to be pulled apart just because of the color of your skin. All this because you can&rsquo;t possibly be right. Then I thought, talking about us living as global citizens, what would happen if Blacks just remain silent and they didn&rsquo;t get involved? I think about what would happen if the Blacks were silent during the recent Muslim ban and only white people advocated for this group. What would happen? Or if Blacks sat out on the Women&rsquo;s March on Washington? I think back on some of the larger issues in recent times &ndash; the crack epidemic, the constant criticism of Obama, and when men of color are being shot dead without cause. Where are all the advocates for us? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, there were some non-Black advocates, but not many when you think that non-Blacks are over 80% of the population. White people have shown up but it seems like there are more that stay silent when these issues arise versus when it&rsquo;s something that directly affects them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So yes, some Black people feel alone, they feel isolated, they feel forgotten, they feel that they put this country on their back and they were never rewarded or acknowledged. There were men of color that went overseas and fought for this country, but when they came back they still couldn&rsquo;t use the same bathroom as a white man. They couldn&rsquo;t sit down at the counter for a cup of coffee. Think about all the Black inventors, mathematicians, and scientists who progressed this country. When you think about the cities that were built on the backs of slaves, but yet they are left out of history books. So please believe me when I say that these are the real fears of Black people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It reminds of an experiment that scientists did with rats during the 1970s. They placed a family of rats in a small box. The family consisted of a father, a mother, and two babies. As long as the family was fed and given proper water, the rats were fine in their small box. The moment the scientists limited their water and took away their food, you saw the father rat turn on the babies and eventually ate them. What can you expect when resources are low and survival is an absolute necessity? You can clearly see the breakdown of the rat family. It&rsquo;s the same thing that happens in the &ldquo;hood.&rdquo; If you take away the male parent, assuming that it is a heterosexual two-parent family unit, that family unit can break down just like the rats did. Thinking back to judicial system for Black men, this is all too common. Did I mention you need to watch <em>13th</em> on Netflix?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Black folk, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, we have much work to do on our end as well. Many of our communities are broken. The crime rates in our communities have risen. We sometimes cannot unify or come together when it&rsquo;s most important. We allow loud and arrogant people to speak out for our communities instead of showing up. Lastly, over the course of generations, Black men have allowed a breakdown in the family structure. Yes, I said allowed. For me to sit here and provide insight as to the challenges that we face, we must first take a look at ourselves. No one is going to help our community, that is strictly up to us. We have to continue to invest in our younger Black generations. They are the future. We need to invest in math, sciences, politics, and Black enterprise. In our inner cities, why are parents more concerned about what&rsquo;s on our children&rsquo;s feet rather than what&rsquo;s in their heads?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever we talk about famous and influential Black people in the community, we always go back to the greats. Frederick Douglass, Thurgood Marshall, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., George Washington Carver, Malcom X, Huey P. Newton, Rosa Parks, Barack Obama, and so on. Is this all that we have? What other influential leaders do our Black students have to look up too? These names ALWAYS come up. We need more influential leaders for our youth to look up to in 2017. What about, Valerie Jarrett, John Conyers, Jr., Mellody Hobson, Cheryl Boone, Toni Morrison, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Maxine Waters, John Lewis, Marian Wright Edelman, Van Jones, and Cornel West? Do you know who all of these famous and influential Black leaders? I don&rsquo;t expect you to. They are not highlighted in our community. We always want to praise the ghost of our people, not that that they shouldn&rsquo;t be recognized for all that they have done. But when do we move on to say there are Black individuals who are now taking the helm and moving us forward? We should be pushing our students to be the next Jesse Williams, Leslie Odom Jr., Charlene Carruthers, Ava DuVernay, Chadwick Boseman, Sage Steele, Issa Rae, and Misty Copeland. If you don&rsquo;t know these names, I guess you have some homework to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My biggest fear is that one day the Black voice will be forgotten and we will become a permanent underclass. We&rsquo;ll never be able to rise up and truly become the people that we need to be. It&rsquo;s just a small fear, but fears aren&#39;t necessarily reality. The reality is that everyone, including those who want to wish bad fortune onto others, will always rise up to something better. No one can do it alone. I don&#39;t want to imagine a society where Blacks just sit stuff out. We can&#39;t sit out! We participated too much to simply give up on this country. We still go to war, we still show up at the marches, we still show up at the campaign rallies, we still show up at the protests, and we still show up at the voting booth knowing that it might not even turn out in our favor. Why? Because we can&#39;t do it alone. We, as a people, don&#39;t want to continue to carry America on our backs. We want everybody to equally share the load with us.</p>', '2020-05-29 13:29:30', '2020-05-29 13:29:30', NULL);

(8, 16, '7', '<p>Throughout my life and time working with diversity programs, I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of cultural differences. Working with admissions for about five years has really shown me some interesting things when it comes to enrollment. Firstly, let&rsquo;s talk about the marketing because it&rsquo;s honestly funny sometimes. Whenever they send out pamphlets or booklets to prospective students, the institution makes sure to include something they think everyone can relate to. For our students who want to be scientist, they send them the picture of a student in their white coat working in a lab. The student athletes see people scoring that winning point or making that amazing play. But then you turn to the page about diversity, and that is one of the funniest! You&rsquo;re going to see a student who is Black, Asian, Latinx, white. Maybe you&rsquo;ll even someone in a wheelchair, someone wearing a LGBTQIA pride shirt, or maybe someone in Greek letters. This big group is going to be sitting together in the dining hall or hanging out on the quad. They&rsquo;re going to look all-inclusive best friends inviting you to come hang out with them. Talk about modern day <em>Breakfast Club</em>, huh? Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s not how our college campuses look. To start out with, is that even an accurate representation of the population. More likely than not, the one picture shows an extremely skewed representation of the campus demographic. Overall, however, it doesn&rsquo;t look like this picture because college is what you make of it. Unfortunately, a lot people stick to people who are similar to themselves. That&rsquo;s why on college campuses you still see the athletes over here, Greek life over there, groups of white students here, groups of Black students over there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we&rsquo;re talking about cultural diversity, we&rsquo;re also talking about the qualities of those individual cultures. We&rsquo;re looking at their beliefs, opinions, customs, food, clothes, and religions. So, when I&rsquo;m thinking about cultural differences, I&rsquo;m thinking about all these categories. I know throughout this book we&rsquo;ve already talked a lot about white and Black issues, but I have another example about the cultural difference, so bear with me. Sometimes when I&rsquo;m at my program, I ask the audience, &ldquo;If you&#39;re a person of color do not respond.&rdquo; I then say, &ldquo;If you&#39;re a white person, or if you identify as being white, please sing me happy birthday.&rdquo; Everybody sings the somewhat monotone version of the song. Then I say, if you&rsquo;re Black, sing me happy birthday and everybody laughs and sings &ldquo;Happy birthday to ya, Happy birthday to ya, happy birthdayyyy (everyone jumps up and starts dancing)!&rdquo; Every person whose white in the audience gets this really funny look on their face like, &ldquo;What the heck is going on, like what is this new song?&rdquo; They start leaning over to their Black friends asking, &ldquo;When did you learn this?&rdquo; Then I make a joke, like, &ldquo;Well before the presentation, me and all the Black students got together and we rehearsed this number.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s interesting because we all start laughing and it gets everyone energized and comfortable. Then we start talking about other kinds of cultural difference we have. One of the big ones that I always point out is how individuals say hello. I often refer back to this one story where a colleague and I were walking down the street and I happened to see another Black man walking towards me. As we got closer to each other the Black guy dapped me up &ndash; no pun intended on Diversity Awareness Program. He gave me a little handshake and said &ldquo;Hey, how you doing?&rdquo; and I responded &ldquo;Good, you?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Good.&rdquo; and we walked our separate ways. My colleague, who happened to be white, looks at me puzzled and says, &ldquo;So, who was that?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know...some Black dude.&rdquo; My colleague was confused and said &ldquo;Well, you said &lsquo;Hi&rsquo; to him, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I responded &ldquo;Well yeah, that&#39;s just what we do. Black people say what&#39;s up to each other.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t believe me that Black people just say &lsquo;hi&rdquo; to each other in passing. He said, &ldquo;Justin, if this is one of your diversity games, I&#39;m not in the mood for it today.&rdquo; I assured him this wasn&rsquo;t a game with, &ldquo;No, it&#39;s a cultural difference. It&#39;s not something that&#39;s good or bad, it&#39;s just something that Black people do when we see each other; we say &lsquo;hi&rsquo; to each other.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Well I&#39;m white I don&#39;t say &lsquo;hi&rsquo; to every single white person that I see.&rdquo; I laughed and said &ldquo;Yeah, I know, because literally you would just line everybody up, and handshake people or high-five everybody as you&#39;re walking down the street.&rdquo; He still didn&rsquo;t believe me, but he saw a Black guy walking across the street and told me to go say &lsquo;hi&rsquo; to him. I said, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t work that way. Every single Black guy I see, I don&#39;t walk up to him and say &lsquo;hello fellow Black man.&rsquo; It doesn&#39;t work like that. Chances are, if he makes eye contact with me, we&rsquo;ll probably connect and we&#39;ll probably speak to each other.&rdquo; To prove my point, I tried to draw attention to me so this guy across the street would notice me. When the Black guy across the street noticed us and we made eye contact, he gave me the head nod. I looked at my white colleague and it looked like his mind just exploded. He said, &ldquo;I just didn&#39;t know that these things existed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So readers, I want to know how many cultural experiences you are having. Are you taking time to really get to know aspects about other people&#39;s culture? Are you really taking the time to have those instructive and informative experiences? I ask, because I know of many different features that cultural difference play into. For example, in the United States, we take a lot of time to make sure we tip our servers in a restaurant. But, I know in Japan and South Korea, tipping is seen as an insult. However, in America, it common practice and expected. When we&rsquo;re happy in America we give thumbs up, meaning approval, agreeance, or encouragement. In the Middle East and in Latin America the thumb up doesn&rsquo;t have the same meaning. It&#39;s almost like giving the middle finger and nobody likes being given the middle finger. In America, when you&rsquo;re out with your friends at a bar and someone has fancy drink or the specialty beer it&rsquo;s fairly common to share a taste. But, did you know in Norway is considered extremely rude and distasteful? It&#39;s all about getting to take the time to truly get to know others and understand their cultures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s bring some of the stuff we talked about in the chapter on perception here. As we know, perception is the lens with which we view the world. This also comes into play when we talk about cultural diversity because there are perceived characteristics of other cultures. Some of these are harmful stereotypes. Sometimes, I think there&#39;s a double standard when it comes to the way that people of color are perceived versus white people. This is something that we place on each other in the community, and how others outside the community view us. For instance, as a 27 year old Black man, let&rsquo;s say I had eighteen kids. What would my reputation be on the streets? Well it probably wouldn&#39;t be good. People would probably say I was a player, that I was irresponsible, or just someone&#39;s baby daddy. Yet if you&rsquo;re white and have nineteen kids, you get a show on TLC called <em>Nineteen Kids and Counting</em>. Also, what if I had multiple wives or girlfriends, maybe even had kids with all of them. What would people probably say about me? They would probably say that I was a player, a pimp, or someone who didn&#39;t really value women. But again, if you are white, you get a TV show on TLC called <em>Sister Wives</em>. As a network, TLC clearly shows white privilege and cultural perceptions. It&rsquo;s not just TLC. Lifetime currently has a show called <em>Married at First Sight</em>. So, in America, we get entertainment out of two strangers meeting once and getting married. Yet, we ridicule other cultures that value arranged marriages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do you go about managing cultural differences? The first step is realizing you are not an expert &ndash; I never consider myself an expert and I work in this field. There is always more to learn and room to grow. Even as a diversity trainer, I&#39;m constantly learning, reshaping, and redefining my definitions of diversity, multiculturalism, and cultural awareness. There are new things that I&#39;m learning every day. Sometimes, I think the sessions are more beneficial for me as the facilitator versus when I was a participant. I have learned so much through the course of ten years. I have encountered over half a million people, each with unique stories, backgrounds, beliefs, ideas, and innovative ways to bring people together. I do not believe that the country is split, although, in reality, it may be. I think that if you actually take the time to individually speak to each person, we all have the same roles. We all have the same wants. We all have the same desires. Everybody wants the ability to have food. Everyone wants to be loved. Everybody wants to have a say. Everyone wants to be heard. People want to know that they have a heart. I do not innately think that everyone in this world is evil. I think there are good people in this world,&nbsp; but sometimes they&rsquo;re just clouded by those who are not as good or didn&rsquo;t make the best choices. I think there are people in this world who really want to do right by people, really truly want to understand how the world operates, and want to make a difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most important things we can leave behind is our knowledge; what we have learned through life that we can share with others. One of the biggest parts of this is being a globally minded person. A person who can see the cultural difference and find the value in others ways of life and their beliefs. That leaves the biggest question &ndash; can you actually spot cultural differences? Would you know a cultural difference if you saw one? I mean there are a lot of different common concepts or themes when it comes to cultural differences; body language, manners, religious beliefs or practices, reactions to problems, mealtimes, greetings, hygiene, family structure, perception of time, gender roles. All those things have to do with cultural differences. Would you even know them if you saw them? I know all of those things sound different but I also know that we all smile in the same language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to realize that cultural knowledge in the workplace is necessary. Meaning, how colleagues represent and share their culture in the workplace and navigate that space based on their experience. Keep in mind that cultures change over time &ndash; they are influenced by economic advancement, globalization, technology, new beliefs, and the influences of other cultures. And of course, these differences in culture influence how people conduct themselves through life, including at work. Can you make room for cultural differences in your life? Think about it. As a reader, are you really willing to bend what you believe and be flexible? So that you can live your everyday life, and so that other individuals can be able to live theirs too? I often think of a colleague of mine who was born in another country &ndash; I honestly can&rsquo;t recall from which country. Whenever this colleague decides to talk to me, he speaks very, very closely. Even when I take a step back he takes a step forward. He&#39;s literally in my face as if he&#39;s about to whisper something to me, but he is at a normal conversational level. Even though it is very uncomfortable for me, I respect that this is how they communicate in his culture. They don&#39;t have the same customary proximity rules as we do in America. You know, the leave the empty seat between you and that stranger system or shuffling to the far corners of the elevator so you don&rsquo;t bump shoulders. As with any person learning and adjusting to a different culture, he forgets sometimes. I try to remind him that he&rsquo;s a bit too close and that people may be turned off by that proximity. And guess what? I don&rsquo;t think he does that out of malice or trying to be intentionally invasive in my private space. But I also don&rsquo;t just blame him either. I have to become flexible knowing that he is more comfortable being closer, so I meet him in the middle. This shows that I value his cultural preference, but also mine is valued as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s all about managing cultural differences. You have to be able to manage and be flexible at the same time. You also have to be aware of how cultural differences affect our day to day lives. These differences have a significant impact on how our nation seeks to understand others and learn different viewpoints. Let&rsquo;s look back to how the media describes different cultures. For example, a certain someone that I know said that all Mexicans are rapists. I don&#39;t believe that. To find out for myself, I went down to Mexico in winter 2016. I had a wonderful time in Cancun and at the ruins of Chichen Itza. I got to jump into the Cenote. I went to Isla Mujeres and I had the best time of my life! But the whole time I was over there I was just really fascinated with how rich, prosperous, and very accommodating their culture was. And when I say rich, I don&rsquo;t mean monetarily, I mean by beliefs, hospitality, how they treat foreigners, how kind people were, the culture, the music, and the food. It was prevalent and I felt immersed in their culture. I didn&#39;t feel like I was American &ndash; just for a second, it felt like I was one of them because of how welcoming they were. In fact, I felt more welcomed over there than I ever have been in America. Oftentimes, I think about all the messages that the media says about people who are Mexican. How dangerous they are. People who say that Mexicans are taking their jobs, but has it happened to them personally? Have you seen a Mexican personally take your job? If not, that&#39;s not necessarily something you should say. Do you know of anybody where a Mexican has taken their job? Think about the 10 closest people to you in your life, did Mexicans take their jobs? Probably not. Yet, that&#39;s always the tagline when we talk about immigration. Mexicans in this country are working jobs that people don&rsquo;t want to work. Most times when you see Mexicans, they aren&rsquo;t CEOs of companies, or creating policy in our government, they&rsquo;re doing the hard, back-breaking work that most Americans wouldn&rsquo;t do. So again, how are they stealing our jobs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people also state how Mexicans are a threat to our democracy and freedom. Well, I got a taste of how threatening a Mexican was while I was visiting their beautiful country. After a night out, I came across a four-year-old boy named Manuel. It was about 4:00 am. Manuel came up to me with the saddest face of any child I&rsquo;ve have ever seen in my life. He was up at this early hour selling bracelets. I sat down with Manuel for a little bit and we actually talked using my very limited amount of Spanish that I learned back in high school. After talking with Manuel, I was able to figure out that he was selling these bracelets so that he could provide for his family. So, of course I bought a few bracelets, but I also broke bread with Manuel and tried to learn more about his life. Of course, this wasn&rsquo;t the easiest with my limited Spanish, but one of the best things I got from it was when he said &ldquo;Me gusto Star Wars.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I like Star Wars.&rdquo; It really made me think about the about the political comments that are happening in our country. I looked right into Manuel&rsquo;s eyes and I thought, &ldquo;This is the person that&#39;s a threat to me?&rdquo; These are the dangerous individuals that we&rsquo;re looking for? This little boy who likes Star Wars and is trying to make things better for his family? It really gave me an opportunity to sit back and think of how many things we&#39;re programmed to think. How we are susceptible to accepting what we&#39;re told or what the media pushed on us. I ended up taking some pictures with him. He really liked that. To think that if a giant wall was actually placed between Manuel and me, we would have never had this experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day when I was walking through town, I saw Manuel again, this time with his father. His father looked exhausted from working all day. Manuel came up and gave me a high-five. I looked at his father and I said &ldquo;Hola.&rdquo; and he responded with &ldquo;Hello...you&rsquo;re American, right?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, I&rsquo;m American.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Okay, cool, I speak English.&rdquo; And I thought wait a minute, in my mind I just thought that everybody that I was coming in contact with only spoke Spanish. I asked him where you learned English. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an American; I just live in Mexico with my family. I was born in America but after I lived there for a while, I came back to Mexico.&rdquo; He asked how I met Manuel and I told him that we met last night and I bought some bracelets. He said &ldquo;Yeah, things are really, really hard down here and I just really want the best for him and I want the best for our family. I don&#39;t make a lot of money but we got family right?&rdquo; I nodded. Even though he looked like he&#39;d been working so hard that day, he still had a smile on his face. It looked like he been through every single hardship that you can think have but he seemed happy. Manuel was up at 4:00 am, yet he was happy. There&#39;s just something about that experience that I wouldn&#39;t trade for the world. These people don&#39;t seem like bad people or people that want to do us harm as Americans. It just seems like people who want to live a good life and want to have great experiences as well, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We talk about how different each person is because of their experiences and their cultures &ndash; how they were raised, their religion, the socioeconomic status, how and where they were educated, their family, their friends. We can see how each person can be so different compared to the person standing next to them. We have to remember that saying &ldquo;all white people&rdquo; or &ldquo;all Black people&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t accurate &ndash; each person conducts themselves differently. When we talk about these concepts, it&rsquo;s very interesting to see where they come from in regards to their culture. At a workshop, I played this game called <em>Ask Any Race Whatever Question You Want.</em> It&#39;s a very interesting game because you could only imagine the type of questions that people ask. Some of the questions consist of people of color asking white people &ldquo;Is clapping on beat really that difficult?&rdquo; Some white people have responded by saying, &ldquo;I just cannot get it, I can&#39;t get it; it&rsquo;s the same reason why I can&#39;t dance.&rdquo; How do Black people dance so well?&rdquo; Black people explain &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just rhythm, you don&rsquo;t have rhythm?&rdquo; White people don&rsquo;t have rhythm? And some white people are like, &ldquo;Sadly, no.&rdquo; But then some white people disagree with &ldquo;Oh my gosh no, I have rhythm, that&#39;s not a thing. Look!&rdquo; then they proceed to get up and dance. A white person asked a Black person, &ldquo;What&#39;s the big difference in your hair? There&rsquo;s not really a big difference is there?&rdquo; And the Black person responded by saying, &ldquo;Oh yes there is. There is a huge difference!&rdquo; They went on to explain the significance of the hair and ended with &ldquo;And can I touch it? Nope, you cannot, so don&rsquo;t ask.&rdquo; Everyone in the audience laughed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone brought up a question about depression, so we talked about mental illness as it is something many people face. From my experiences, when white people talk about mental illness, they talk about resources and medication &ndash; they accept that this is something that exists. Where people in the Black community &ndash; again, from my experience &ndash; don&#39;t really refer to mental illness or accept it as a real thing. They might say, &ldquo;You just need to take some time off.&rdquo; or &ldquo;You&#39;re trippin&rsquo;.&rdquo; You hear, &ldquo;You need to go to church, you need to pray it away.&rdquo; I wish my culture paid more attention to mental illness because it&#39;s something that is real and affects our community. The issue of mental illness recently came to light when a rap artist named Kid Cudi, checked himself into a mental institution. I think that is when young Black men really started seeing mental illness as a real thing. Other Black celebrities have brought to light the damaging effects of mental illness if not treated as well. While more light is being shined in this area, I&rsquo;m still afraid mental illness isn&rsquo;t recognized in the Black community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember in one of my sessions, someone from the Black community wanted to know if white people actually had family reunions or was that just a Black thing. They responded by saying, &ldquo;Absolutely we have family reunions. We might not have them every year but family reunions are like our equivalent to Thanksgiving.&rdquo; People from the Black community said that they are used to having barbeques and get-togethers all year long. Black people asked white people why some whites riot when they win sports games and also riot when they lose sports games. The white people responded by saying, &ldquo;It&#39;s just fun to riot. &ldquo;But I don&#39;t necessarily think that&#39;s true for everybody.&rdquo; As the facilitator, doing these activities as a focus group I know these comments aren&rsquo;t necessary a true thing, nor should they be taken as facts. Just like when people say, &ldquo;Racism is over because the president was Black.&rdquo; Well, you know that simply isn&rsquo;t true. Diversity doesn&#39;t equal white genocide. It doesn&#39;t mean that minorities will one day take over the world and we&rsquo;ll all be so mixed that white people will die out. What it means is that we&#39;re all becoming a blended nation. There won&rsquo;t be a Blacks or white only section in Heaven, so we may as well all start to get to know each other and get along now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One funny question that was asked by someone from the white community to people of color was, &ldquo;How come Black people are always screaming in movie theaters during horror movies?&rdquo; Everyone laughed. People from the Black community responded by saying, &ldquo;Well we&#39;re screaming because white people are always making the dumb mistakes and they&#39;re getting killed...we&#39;re trying to save you all. &lsquo;Hurry up, get out of there.&rsquo; Ya&rsquo;ll don&rsquo;t really listen.&rdquo; As a facilitator, my observations of this game is that individuals truly let their guards down. They become fully immersed in the dialogue and truly ask some serious questions. Again, there are many questions that are asked that are simply silly, but you get a sense that the separated group starts to blend. It&rsquo;s no longer a &ldquo;us versus them&rdquo; mentality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The questions continue to go back and forth. I remember once, someone from the white community asked, &ldquo;Why are you Black people so offended when people use the &lsquo;N&rsquo; word but you use it all the time?&rdquo; It was interesting to see the responses on this question because the Black audience was split on this particular subject. Some people in the Black audience responded by saying, &ldquo;I don&#39;t like the &lsquo;N&rsquo; word either. It&#39;s terrible and should never be used.&rdquo; Some other Blacks tried to justify it saying, &ldquo;We use the &lsquo;N&rsquo; word as a term of endearment. We don&#39;t mean it in the negative connotation.&rdquo; Language and reclaiming words is an interesting thing. What does the &lsquo;N&rsquo; word mean now? And, who has the right and privilege over the &lsquo;N&rsquo; word? Who has the ability to say when it&#39;s appropriate and who is allowed say it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were many important questions brought up, and we can&rsquo;t go into every single one, but I like to point out the questions that caused a lot of discussion. One of those questions was the debate on whether Jesus was a person of color. In modern America, he&#39;s always depicted as being someone who is light skinned with long, wavy hair, strong muscles, and blue eyes. The bible teaches that Jesus was from the Middle East. It says his hair was like wool and his skin was like bronze. These characteristic mean that he was probably a man of color. Many different questions stemmed from that original question. I think one of my favorite questions was, &ldquo;How come Black people seem to have ghetto names?&rdquo; There were some interesting responses and comments at this question. It seemed the conclusion on that question was that Black parents want to make their children have special or unique names. Even some parents even going as far as to naming their child Uniqua. My mom did the very same thing. Who has a middle name like LaKyle? That&rsquo;s not a thing but everybody wants their child to have a unique name. I bet you there&#39;s no other Justin LaKyle Brown in this world other than me. My conclusion with this activity is that we have to continue to bring people together. Whether that&#39;s by hosting programs, having developmental conversations, or by having programs with learning outcomes that support the initiatives of our institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, I must point out that during during this activity,, it is usually people who are white and people who are Black that are very active. Not many questions are asked of other races or backgrounds, in fact, many people from different races or backgrounds often remain silent or untouched. Why do you think that is? In my opinion, I believe it&rsquo;s because, again, in America, we only care about and focus on issues of Black or white. Things cannot be like that. They are not this or that. There has to be some gray area. I&rsquo;d be interested in pointing this out in the future to gain reasoning as to why those individuals do not speak up or ask more questions. My observations show me that they are merely continuing to learn the culture. They do so by observing the activity, rather than participating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, this chapter brings me to a very funny story that my grandfather always told whenever he went to multicultural churches. It&rsquo;s a funny story that I&rsquo;m actually stealing from him but giving him the credit. My grandfather often tells this story about zebras. He said there once was a zebra that died and went to heaven. It wanted to know, once and for all, the answer to an age old question. Was he a zebra that was black with white stripes or a zebra that was white with black stripes? So he went to go ask John the Baptist and said, &ldquo;Hey, I want to finally answer the age old question.&rdquo; John the Baptist said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; The zebra asked, &ldquo;Am I a white zebra with black stripes or a black zebra with white stripes?&rdquo; John the Baptist said, &ldquo;Well, hold on I&#39;ll go ask the maker (God).&rdquo; Later on he came back and said to the zebra, &ldquo;Zebra, I have an answer for you.&rdquo; The zebra said, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; John the Baptist said, &ldquo;You are what you are.&rdquo; The zebra said, &ldquo;Oh, that makes perfect sense. That means that I&#39;m a white zebra with black stripes.&rdquo; John the Baptist was confused and asked &ldquo;How do you figure that?&rdquo; The zebra then stated, &ldquo;Because, if the maker had told me I was a black zebra with white stripes, he would have said, &lsquo;You is what you is.&rsquo;&rdquo; I tell that joke often and audiences always meet me with laughter. A very funny joke, but nevertheless, it brings people together and makes a point. Different cultures work so much more effectively when we can work together and work collaboratively rather than being at odds with one another.</p>', '2020-05-29 13:30:10', '2020-05-29 13:30:10', NULL);

(9, 17, '8', '<p>Anything you can do, I can do better. I can do anything better than you. No you can&rsquo;t &ndash; yes I can! No you can&rsquo;t &ndash; yes I can! One of the most famous battles of all time is this battle between men and women. Who&#39;s better, who&#39;s more equipped, who&#39;s the smartest, and who should be running the country? Is a certain gender more athletic than the other? Should they get paid more than the other? These age old battles are happening every day. As a society we have yet to figure out if there are even answers to these questions. I personally think there should be gender equality in all aspects of life, so I think the answer is neither. It shouldn&rsquo;t matter what your gender or how you identify. Everyone should receive equal treatment. Unfortunately, our society doesn&rsquo;t work like that. Gender inequality is a real thing. It refers to the unequal treatment of individuals based on their gender, generally women. This inequality is evident in regards to opportunities, salary, experiences, and overall treatment. This happens to women much more than it does for men in regards to their careers, education, economic advancement, or political influence. There are several different gender based activities that we play and I want to talk about those in this chapter, as well as the differences that I&#39;ve learned between men and women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before moving forward, we need to discuss gender and gender identity. Even though a lot of this chapter focuses on men and women, as a society we need to recognize that gender is beyond a binary. Not every person is cisgender, meaning they are female/feminine and identifies as a woman, or &nbsp;male/masculine and identifies as a man. Just as there are many ways for individuals to identify their sexuality, there are many forms of gender identity. Let&rsquo;s not forget about our trans and genderqueer community who certainly face many inequalities in our society. As a cisgender man, I have a privilege I must recognize &ndash; it&rsquo;s easy for me to automatically talk about issues that directly affect me. I want you to know that when it comes to this chapter, I writing from my perspective. Yes, as someone who works in the diversity education field, I try to check my privilege, but I&rsquo;m not perfect. I wanted to let you know that this chapter may appear very biased when it comes that view, but I didn&rsquo;t want you to think that I had forgotten about you all. You play an intricate part in our society and it needs to be recognized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being transgender can mean many things and can be represented in many different ways &ndash; after all, it is about how that person identities. Generally speaking, a trans person is someone whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with the sex and gender automatically assigned at birth. This means that a person&rsquo;s outward representation may not align with their internal self. There are so many ways this is represented in a person, but many automatically think of a man who see themself as a woman, and therefore dresses like a woman, or vice versa. This is not all that trans is &ndash; each person is in a different stage of understanding who they are and each present and identify that self in different ways. Before the chapter truly begins, I want to ensure that you know what it means to be trans, at least from my understanding, considering I am self-aware and recognize that I am not trans and cannot truly speak on those issues. It&rsquo;s important that individuals stay informed and become an ally. Attend an ally training. That training is priceless. How can you be an ally of transgender individuals? Well first, you can&#39;t tell that someone is transgender just by looking at them. Transgender people don&#39;t have a &ldquo;look.&rdquo; We can&rsquo;t make assumptions about others. If you&#39;re not sure of what pronouns to use, you need to ask because defining someone else&rsquo;s pronouns is inappropriate and disrespectful. I remember when Caitlyn Jenner changed her pronoun from he to she and transition into a woman. People would say, &ldquo;No, no, no, no, Bruce Jenner is still a man and I&#39;m going to identify him as a man.&rdquo; Well, that decision is not up to you. It&rsquo;s up to the individual and how they want to be identified and we have to support and respect that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same way that it is impolite to assume someone&rsquo;s pronouns, it&rsquo;s also rude to ask transgender individuals what their real name is. Their name is exactly what they choose it to be. We have to be open and accepting of who that individual is and not dwell on what society assigned to them at birth. In the same regards, we have to be respectful &ndash; just because a trans person has come out to you, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they are out to the world. I recall doing training for individuals who were all males and based on the discussions, I assume the majority of the room were cisgender and heterosexual. The group said &ldquo;Justin, I can&#39;t mess with these transgender people. They make me confused, they freak me out, and I just don&#39;t get it.&rdquo; I replied back, &ldquo;Well, what freaks you out when you&#39;re talking about individuals who identify as transgender?&rdquo; The student stated, &ldquo;What freaks me out is I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m talking to a man or a woman. I could be standing there talking to a woman that has a penis. I don&#39;t know if the woman has a penis or not so I got to ask.&rdquo; I was a bit confused, so I asked, &ldquo;So that is your relationship advice to men who are trying to talk to women. You go up to every single woman and say, &lsquo;Hey I noticed you looking at me and I want to know do you have a penis?&rsquo;&rdquo; Everyone in the audience died of laughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not the way you would approach anyone you were trying to romantically pursue, or communicate with in general. Knowing what sexual organs a person has does not change how you talk to them and not knowing shouldn&rsquo;t make you uncomfortable. So, going up and asking people that question is not okay, it&rsquo;s none of your concern unless that person wants to share this identity with you. I&#39;m not from the transgender community, so I can&#39;t speak upon their issues, what they feel, or how they&#39;re being discriminated against. I can become an ally. I want to use the opportunity to speak upon these issues to show that I am an ally and encourage you to become an ally too. Becoming an ally is more than just words. It&rsquo;s a call to action. If you are not actively doing something, you are not an ally. Having a sticker on your door claiming your office as a Safe Space isn&rsquo;t enough. You have to stay up to date on issues and be part of the movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respecting the terminology is important for all people, especially those in the LGBTQIA community. You must be cognizant of your language and be respectful of those transitioning or questioning. It&rsquo;s not for you to decide who someone else is. Some of the most alarming things I hear is are people purposefully calling a trans person out of name or saying &ldquo;Well, they have to be gay. Look at them.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bi isn&rsquo;t real. Just pick a side. You&rsquo;re confused.&rdquo; I hear a lot from my friends in the LGBTQIA community that there is a lot of discrimination amongst themselves. People not accepting trans people, bisexual, queer, questioning, and so forth within their own community. This occurs by other LGBTQIA people promoting the misconception that bisexual can&rsquo;t be monogamous or are confused. It is gay men shaming each other for body type and appearance. You see it with lesbians claiming true lesbians are those who hold the &ldquo;gold star,&rdquo; meaning those who had never been with a man before. But again, I am not a member of this community, so I can&rsquo;t speak on its behalf. I am just sharing stories I hear from friends or throughout my work each day. Either way, we all, regardless of how you identify, need to stop putting others down just so we can feel better. We have got to be better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#39;ve got to make sure that we have trans-inclusive communities. I think that that&#39;s really important topic. Is your language, your friends, or the company that you keep, trans-inclusive? If you had a trans friend, would you be comfortable bringing them into your community? Do we take time to listen to transgender individual&rsquo;s needs and wants? We need to support gender neutral bathrooms. I don&#39;t know why Target had such a big backlash. At the end of the day, everybody has to go to the bathroom. Who cares which door they go into? Are we truly listening or are we saying, &ldquo;I have a trans friend so that means that I&#39;m trans- friendly?&rdquo; Again, that&rsquo;s not<em> being </em>an ally. Being and ally is a call to action; having the ability to support those individuals in the ways that they need to be supported not what we think is best for them. And, at the end of the day, like I said, I&#39;m not from the trans community. Therefore, I know my limits as should you as the reader. You&#39;re not going to be able to do everything. Sometimes being ally means showing up and shutting up. I learned this concept when I went to my first <em>Speak Out</em>. This was an enlightening opportunity to hear the testimonies and heartbreaking stories of individuals. It truly changed my life because I didn&rsquo;t see what life without my privilege could be like. Sometimes, we need to just be a physical presence. This is sometimes the best support we can offer. Just because you are not speaking doesn&rsquo;t mean you are not effective. Those are my tips for working with people who may identify differently than you. Again, I want to reiterate that this chapter is really going to focus on my experiences dealing with men and women that mostly identify as cisgender and heterosexual. I wanted to make sure that I did not leave anybody out of the conversation and that this book was inclusive for all readers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting back to the chapter, growing up as a Black male, I was taught many different things, especially when it comes to women. I was taught you don&#39;t hit girls. I was taught you hold the door open for women and always remain chivalrous. I was taught to use manners, don&#39;t curse around women, and make sure they&#39;re okay. I was taught to make sure that they&#39;re on the inside of the sidewalk when you&#39;re walking down the street, if they&#39;re cold you give them your jacket, and if it&#39;s raining hold the umbrella open for them. When you&#39;re out and about, make sure that you protect them. I always ask students whether or not they think chivalry is dead. Most of my male students will say, &ldquo;Yeah, chivalry is dead and it was killed by women.&rdquo; This is a question I really want to examine. Is chivalry really dead? Are these concepts that I just talked about, which I adapted from the way my father raised me, still concepts that people follow in 2017, or does it not matter? Gender equality is important. It should not matter whether you are a male or female; everyone should be treated equally. As a male growing up, I found that there were times that I did things chivalrously, but they not received so well. For example, I would hold doors for ladies and they would tell me that they can open the door themselves. If I tried to help a young lady who was trying to pick up a heavy box, they would say tell me that they could do it themself. I started to realize, maybe what I was taught isn&rsquo;t applicable in the world today or appreciated by modern women. I have met several females who still appreciate a chivalrous man and look for that quality. Do women want men to be chivalrous but still respect that they are their own independent individual? What does that look like?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we&rsquo;ll go back to the original topic of the chapter, the battle of the genders. There are two activities on this topic. The first game is very similar to <em>This or That</em>, except one side of the room is <em>Male</em> and the other side is <em>Female</em>. In this game called <em>This or That: Men and Women Edition</em>, I have a list of words that are all adjectives. These adjectives do not pertain to any particular sex or gender at all. I begin to call out the adjectives and ask the participants to choose what side they believe the adjective describes. But again, they cannot stand in the middle. There is no right or wrong answer. It&rsquo;s quite thought-provoking to see how people determine why they chose either side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, let&rsquo;s take a look. I explain the rules to the group and everyone immediately gets excited! The first word is <em>Breadwinner.</em> The group splits up, some going to the men side, some to the women&rsquo;s side. I immediately go to the men&rsquo;s side, which is now a mix of men and women, just to see what they have to say. I hear things like, &ldquo;My father brought home most of the bacon. He was our provider growing up.&rdquo; Then I go to the women&rsquo;s side. Many of those comments consists of how their parents are divorced, that their father wasn&rsquo;t active in their lives, or their father just split on day. They talked about the impact their mom made as a single parent; a mother raising them alone and providing for them. These individuals were saying their mother had multiple jobs, was going to school, and was still an active mother. When we talk about this <em>Breadwinner</em> concept, we really have to understand that the divorce rate is very high in America. Many people come from broken homes and single parent homes. A great deal of these students really take the time to express this in the session. They want to share because their experiences were different from those who had two parent homes or those with active fathers. The participants go very deep in regards to their family history and experiences. Families aren&rsquo;t the little nuclear families of the past anymore where mom stays home taking care of the house and family while dad goes to work. Sure, these family structures exist, but it is not the norm as it was 60 years ago. This story that describes dad coming home from a long day, right in time for dinner is no longer the American story. Lots of American families are being raised by one parent or a guardian. Children are not always being raised by a mom and dad &ndash; let&rsquo;s not forget about our same-sex parents either. We can&rsquo;t ignore all those dads who are single parents either. We so often talk about absent fathers, bur sometimes moms split too. I hear countless stories of individuals who were raised by grandparents, aunts, uncles, teachers, coaches, and even church members. According to today&rsquo;s statistics, one third of American families are split up. It&rsquo;s not necessarily mom and dad anymore and this is a huge eye-opener for some students who&rsquo;ve grown up with two parents who were happily married. It&rsquo;s unusual for them to hear about families having issues or families being separated by divorce. For some students, these are new concepts because it has not been their experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next word I use is <em>Submissive</em>. Again, much like the first word, the students will choose whatever side they feel is right for them.<em> </em>The submissive one is very stimulating because depending on what type of attitude the particular male or female has will define their answer. Each word is purposefully ambiguous. This leaves the term up for interpretation by the participant. For example, when I go to the <em>Female</em> side, a lot of the women say, &ldquo;Well, women are supposed to be submissive to their man; that&rsquo;s what the Bible says.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I remember my mother being very submissive to my father.&rdquo; And then there are some on the <em>Female</em> side that say, &ldquo;I would never submit to a man. My examples of men have not been that great; whether in relationships with men that I&rsquo;ve been in or otherwise.&rdquo; Remember, you have to pick a side. There is no gray area. So, while this person would never be submissive, they still had to choose a side. It may not be their reality but they see the societal influence. Some students go into great detail about relationships with men where there was physical or emotional violence or bullying. A good deal of women, as well as men, felt forced into a submissive role by men in their lives. A lot of women go into great detail about their relationships with men or the examples that were or were not set by their fathers. Of course, violence does not just affect women, it affects men as well, and violence can be perpetuated by women too. This highlights their stance on why they will not be submissive. For the most part, the men standing on the <em>Female </em>side believe that women should be submissive or that is what society perpetrates, hence explaining where they stood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next word that I use in the activity is <em>Privilege</em>. <em>Privilege</em> is another thought-provoking term because the majority of people will go over to the <em>Male</em> side while there&#39;s only a few that stay on <em>Female</em> side. I always let the underdog go first so I go to the <em>Female </em>side where just a few women are standing there. The women say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re privileged because we have more education. There are more women in education then there has ever been. There are smarter women. There are more women coming into science and technology.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Women will always be privileged because we carry life.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s very fascinating when individuals talk about women carrying life. Where would men be without women? I think it&#39;s important to add that life does comes from women, but that is not their sole purpose in life. So where do men get off saying what women should or should not be doing with their bodies? They attempt to make decision on whether or not they should be able to prevent pregnancy or have an abortion. It&#39;s remarkable that the government can also to determine or dictate what women should do with their bodies. I digress &ndash; this <em>Privilege</em> term is very open ended and usually leads to the group talking about having children. Several women that are on the privilege side say, &ldquo;I have the privilege to decide whether or not I want kids and it doesn&#39;t make me a bad person because I don&#39;t want them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, on the other side, people say that men have the privilege. Men make the world go round. Men are the entrepreneurs. They&#39;re the ones that determine the rules that make up this country. Even though Beyonc&eacute; sings &ldquo;Who run the world&hellip;girls,&rdquo; in retrospect, who really runs the world? The answer is the cisgender, heterosexual, Christian, white males. And, once they get in government, they&#39;re the ones that make, execute, and enforce laws. They have the most money. They&rsquo;re the ones that develop policy. They&#39;re the ones that are usually in law enforcement. So when it comes to privilege, quite naturally, men are seen as those holding the privilege. But, does it apply to all men? What about men of color? What about LGBTQIA identified men? Does the same privilege apply to them, or are they just left out on the side? Are there different levels of privilege? So, as a man, can I be on the top tier of privilege, but then move down a notch for being Black, but still higher on the privilege scale than a woman? It&#39;s really exciting to knock out those concepts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next word that we use in this activity is <em>Nurturer.</em> Now, nurture is intriguing because it can be hit or miss; it just depends on who played the dominant role in an individual&#39;s life. Some males say they felt that their mothers were the nurturers, while some women felt their fathers were the nurturers. Interestingly enough, many people have problems with this one because the nurturer isn&rsquo;t always a parent. Sometimes a nurturer is a pastor, Sunday school teacher, coach, or a teacher. Sometimes a nurturer is a grandparent. Sometimes a nurturer is a very close neighbor or family friend. Nurturers aren&#39;t necessarily always family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words and terms continue to fly as we move along this activity. Some of the words used are <em>Smart</em>, <em>Intelligent</em>, <em>Violent</em>, and <em>Accommodating</em>. These words get students to break out of their shells and really try to hone in on what are the bigger issues. It is clear that the issues surrounding gender truly program us to believe we have specific roles in society. But, who determines gender roles? Are these determined straight from birth? Are these things that we learned in grade school? Are they just general concepts that are just picked up from society? And how are we determined to complete our roles?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People learn a lot about relationships based on what they observed growing up. For me, I think that relationships must be a 50-50 job. I know that in order to pick up a box, an individual needs two hands. Without two hands, you can&rsquo;t pick up the box. That&rsquo;s a 50-50 role even if one of the individuals in that role might be more dominant. For me, I&rsquo;m right handed. So my right hand is dominant but there are a lot of things that my right hand can&#39;t do without my left hand. It&rsquo;s a 50-50 partnership making things work cohesively. Individuals need to work better at building relationships. In today&rsquo;s society, people just get up and run when things get hard. No one wants to tough it out because the focus is on me, me, ME!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the sessions however, relationships are a central theme, especially breakups. After all, our experiences shape how we see the world. Breakups are rough! Have you ever been through a breakup? Have you ever had your heart broken? Have you had someone mislead you about who they were or what their intentions were? Have you had someone lie to you &ndash; act like they were your friend, but then stab you in the back? When we talk about people in relationships, there are a great deal of interesting patterns that come about. Stories about several heartbreaks that could have been prevented if people just communicated properly or let their intentions be known. This is not an all-male thing. Many females feel as though they get a bad rap. Many individuals are not having these developmental conversations. This issue is what leads to the next game, <em>Men Hear&hellip;Women Hear</em>. The purpose of this activity is to give individuals the opportunity to hear what each other has to say without being interrupted or being defensive. Essentially, I ask all the people who identify as a women to stand in the front of the room. They are given are ten minutes to talk about men &ndash; they have the floor and can say whatever they want. Then I say to the men, who are sitting in the audience that their job is to sit there and listen. I wish you could see the looks on the people&rsquo;s faces in the room! Some faces light up and people are excited and some people moan and groan. It&#39;s fascinating to hear the different concepts that women describe versus what men say. I want to give you a tidbit of what some of the women say during this activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the women go first, because like I said, I&rsquo;m still a chivalrous man, but we&#39;ll talk about the real purpose a bit later. Typically, the men have sour faces, saying things like, &ldquo;What do you mean we can&rsquo;t say anything?&rdquo; I tell them to just hold up, they&rsquo;ll have their turn. The women then begin their part of the activity and the information begins to flow. They are saying that there is a double standard for men and women. If a woman goes out and sleeps with a bunch of people, she&#39;s a slut, but if a man goes and does it he&#39;s praised and high-fived. I even heard a quote about this, &ldquo;A lock that&rsquo;s opened by many keys is a bad lock but a key that opens many locks is a great key.&rdquo; Women complained about men cheating, lying, and being dogs. The women often talk about men not listening, not knowing their needs, and being insensitive. They speak a lot about men blaming situations on woman&#39;s menstrual cycles. The women believe that it is because men are being insensitive and not really paying attention to women&#39;s emotions. The women talk about men having pride and not being able to see situations from women&#39;s point of view because they&#39;re too busy looking at it from their point of view. The women also talk about men just being so headstrong, never stopping to make plans, or being impulsive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the conversation shifts almost right before the ten minutes are over. I assume that women have gotten everything out of their system that they needed to say. Usually one person says, &ldquo;Well everybody, we all just need to hold up. It&#39;s not all men, it&rsquo;s some men.&rdquo; And then everybody chimes in with, &ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s only some men.&rdquo; Then the conversation shifts. Instead of talking about how bad men are, all the ladies in the room talk about how good men are. They share that their father is a good man or that their boyfriend&#39;s good to them &ndash; that not all men are bad. They say some men do listen, some men really do care, and some men really are considerate. Then, I promise you, almost like clockwork, the last minute or thirty seconds of this conversation, someone throws out, &ldquo;But sometimes women&hellip;&rdquo; As if they didn&rsquo;t hear the original assignment, all the women completely change the conversation. Now they&rsquo;re not talking about men anymore, it&rsquo;s women talking about women, completely going off topic. But we will come back to that!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I allow the men to come up for their turn. Normally this happens one of two ways. Either the men are all fired up due to what the women said or the men just really don&#39;t have anything real to say. They&rsquo;ll just say women smell good, they look good, they&#39;re okay sometimes, and my mom&rsquo;s a woman and that&#39;s pretty much it. There are many different ways to combat this. It isn&rsquo;t normally until I pull both groups together that there are some real informative and intentional thought processes. What I mean by that is, when I bring both groups together I say, &ldquo;What do you think about what each other said?&rdquo; Many people say, I never really saw it from that perspective. We talked about perspective in a previous chapter &ndash; it&#39;s all in how you see things based upon your past experiences. All of those concepts are important. What we also learned from the two groups is that women sometimes attack other women or try and bring each other down. Do women attack women more or do men attack women more? What we start to realize is that there are a lot of women that are also attacking women, sometimes worse than men do. There are certainly empowering women movements where women start encouraging and uplifting each other. You don&#39;t usually see a lot of men knocking other men down. So why does this happen with women?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A common theme consistently arises out of these conversations &ndash; individuals are hurt. They are hurting due to people or situations from their pasts. More commonly, past relationships. As we discussed in a previous chapter, pain is pain. It not only affects you emotionally, it can affect you physically and mentally. Unfortunately, to most people&rsquo;s detriment, it can change your entire outlook on life. What we start to notice is that hurt people, hurt people. Sometimes people can only meet you as far as they&rsquo;ve already met themselves. People are still learning who they are. In this self-discovery phase, people they potentially care about can and will be hurt. It is part of life is regrettable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine meeting people every single day who do not know who they are. They don&rsquo;t know what their self-worth is. There exists individuals who don&#39;t know what they want to do in life. They don&#39;t have any goals, ambitions, or values. They only learn what they&#39;re doing based upon their friends or what&#39;s happening on social media. You&rsquo;d be surprised as to how many people out there fit this description. Are you one of them? This is not strictly reserved for those in adolescence, there are many adults that fall into this category. Imagine being 28- years old and not being mature or stable. You&rsquo;re not paying your own bills, you&rsquo;re not working towards a goal, just going wherever the wind takes you. Where do you find your grounding? Where do you find your purpose? When do you wake up and decide I&rsquo;m really going to get myself together? Sometimes, it&rsquo;s all a matter of sitting down and really figuring out what I want to do with my life. Only you can bring yourself to this realization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes this realization comes through a breakup or maybe through something like bankruptcy. Sometimes the reality comes through the loss of a loved one. As they say, the three greatest teachers in life are heartbreaks, empty pockets, and failures. These are the things that teach you the greatest and harshest lessons in life. These three teachers can be the hardest, but you can certainly pass the class. We notice that some people come into your life for a season and some come for a lifetime. You can&#39;t mix up seasonal people with lifetime expectations. You also can&#39;t force people to stay in your life &ndash; staying is a choice. You&#39;ve got to be thankful for the people who choose you for you! One day you&rsquo;ll look back and understand why it all happened. It takes a strong person to remain single in a world that&rsquo;s accustomed to settling for anything just to say they have something. Sometimes people won&rsquo;t even leave relationships because they feel it is their only option. I always speak up about relationships because I became stronger through the pain of a breakup. There were some days I had to get up and decide, &ldquo;Today I&#39;m going to make sure that I am happy and I&rsquo;m doing it for me.&rdquo; I cognitively made a choice that I was going to exude positivity; not only in my life but in the lives of others. I always want to be a beacon of light or a servant to those who needed help; I want to have a servant leadership heart. I want to be able to have selfless care for other people, and of course self-care to keep myself whole. Everyone doesn&rsquo;t want that nor do they accept it. Not everyone is going to know how to handle you or receive your energy. That&rsquo;s not your problem. It&rsquo;s best for you to just make peace with that and move on because not everybody&#39;s going to appreciate who you are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got to trust yourself. You&rsquo;ve got to trust your heart. You&rsquo;ve got to trust in your own abilities. Don&rsquo;t let mixed signals fool you. If people want to be with you they will, and if they don&rsquo;t, they won&rsquo;t. Indecision is a decision. You&rsquo;re only contained by the walls that you build yourself. Building a wall is a great thing; it keeps all of the negatve people out but it also keeps you trapped in. I remember when my wall was first broken; it was awkward for me to talk to people. I remember a woman came up to me and told me I was handsome. I had no idea what was going on and I responded with &ldquo;Happy Birthday?!&rdquo; Yes, that really happened. We&rsquo;ve got to stop changing who we are for people who don&#39;t even know themselves. Ultimately the battle of the genders is a really interesting topic. It&#39;s one that students really love and we talk about the most often. Most importantly, we all realize that we all have shortcomings, we&#39;re all works in progress, and none of us are perfect. We just continue to strive for what we think is best. We try to make sure that our basic needs are met and that we&#39;re all searching for this little sense of happiness.</p>', '2020-05-29 13:31:08', '2020-05-29 13:31:08', NULL);

(10, 18, '9', '<p>I had pretty prominent women in my life growing up; one of them being my mother. She&rsquo;s a very strong woman who didn&#39;t show you too many weaknesses. She wanted to not only be strong for her family but for herself. I have to give it up to the women, especially in this chapter. In case you couldn&rsquo;t tell, this chapter is all about women because women just go through a lot of unnecessary circumstances that they don&#39;t need to go through in this world. Society makes it that women are second class citizens. Depending on what type of woman you are, you could be lower than a second class citizen. And I&rsquo;m sorry, but I personally believe that America is more sexist than it is racist. Women have to go through hardships that men never will, yet men constantly and consistency comment on these issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Growing up as a man and seeing these hardships firsthand made me very sensitive to women&#39;s issues. I have two younger sisters. I was very close to my mom. I was very close to both of my grandmothers. I had aunts, I had cousins, and they were all women. They did not hide the fact that men need to be more sensitive and that men need to be quieter on issues that have nothing to do with them. That just because they&#39;re on their period, it is not a reason they respond so directly or are upset. Think about it, if you&#39;re a man reading this book, how many times do you hear any of the following on a daily basis: You&#39;re wearing that? You&#39;re overly sensitive. You&rsquo;d be prettier if you wore makeup! You run like a girl. Girls can&rsquo;t be on the team. Girls can&#39;t do that. It must be your time of the month. You just haven&rsquo;t found the right man. You&rsquo;re never going to get a man looking like that. You&#39;d be so much prettier if you just smiled. What war on reproductive rights? She must have been asking for it. Calm down. Slut. Your clothing is distracting the boys. Your husband is totally whipped. Why are you getting so emotional? He picks on you because he likes you. You&rsquo;re too bossy. Stay at home mom...get a job! Working mom...why are you neglecting your kids? You&#39;re too old to dress like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come on now, men, when have you ever heard those things? You didn&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t! Why? Because there&#39;s a double standard when it comes to women and men in America. If one man can destroy everything why can&#39;t one woman change that? Why can&#39;t one woman build everything? We have women in our own lives that had to protect their families by biting their own tongues to preserve a man&rsquo;s ego. So, when we&#39;re talking about these issues, there are double standards in all things. There are double standards for women in the workplace. There are double standards for women in marriage. There are double standards for women in the type of careers that they choose. There are double standards for women in education. There are double standards for women when they&#39;re growing up in grade school. There are double standards for some women compared to other women. Sometimes it seems that women cannot succeed because something is always against them. And, if they can succeed, they have to work twice as hard to prove they deserved that success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A big issue that is still facing women today, which people just don&#39;t want to talk about, is rape and sexual assault. As an educator, I don&#39;t understand why we do not talk about sexual assault in grade school. It doesn&#39;t make any sense. I don&#39;t get it. We talk about sexual health education in K-12, but a lot of schools are trying to do away with that too. While the subject can be confusing to younger students, talking about sexual assault and rape to preteens and teenagers could create the changes we need. Of course it won&rsquo;t completely stop assaults from happening, but talking about consent and the like early could certainly reduce occurrences. Even the education is unfair for what we&#39;re teaching men and women. For example, we tell women: don&#39;t go out dressed like that; don&#39;t put your drink down; make sure you go out with friends; don&#39;t be flirty; don&#39;t wear your hair a certain way, don&#39;t seem like you&#39;re trying to turn him on&hellip;don&rsquo;t&hellip;don&rsquo;t&hellip;don&rsquo;t&hellip;don&rsquo;t&hellip;Don&rsquo;t! And what do we teach men? No means no. Boys will be boys. And then, we only teach people that sexual assault only happens to women when it happens to men as well. There isn&rsquo;t enough data or evidential support to assess how much sexual assault is actually happening to men because most men are encouraged <em>not</em> to come forward or made to feel guilty about victimization. As a male, they don&#39;t want to become the butt of a joke so they don&rsquo;t come forward. This prevents us from having accurate data. I mean, statistically speaking, we don&rsquo;t have 100% accurate data for sexual assault against women either. Many women don&#39;t come forward because they think that people will not believe them. They don&rsquo;t want to be re-traumatized by telling the story or they don&#39;t want to be told it was their fault. That&#39;s terrible! What sort of society do we live in where women, who we claim we need and love, cannot come forward to say they have been assaulted, raped, or abused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to teach our men that rape is rape; not boys will be boys. That there is no maybe when it comes to consent &ndash; the absence of a &ldquo;no&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; It doesn&#39;t mean try harder or buy her another drink. There is a rapist on a campus, who happens to be a talented swimmer, that got three months in jail for assaulting an unconscious student. That is a major problem! We have judges saying more significant punishments would severely impact the rapist future. Well, what about that woman who was assaulted? What about her future &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t she deserve justice? It sets up a precedent for our young men and shows them that rape culture is acceptable. What if something like this happened to you, your best friend, or your sibling? Can we then all agree that is not okay? But again, if its not a personal issue, then it&rsquo;s not an issue at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear men talking about how women need to stay in their place, that they need to do this or they shouldn&#39;t do that. How can you command this? Do you not have a woman in your life that you actually care about? Our current system and way of living cannot stay in place. Silencing of women is heartbreaking. I think that whenever women are speaking up about something, they&#39;re immediately silenced. If I&rsquo;m in the workplace and I have an innovative idea, people would say to me, &ldquo;Wow, Justin is really going all out.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Justin is really using his noggin&rsquo; and really pushing us forward.&rdquo; If a woman speaks up to say something, then all of a sudden, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Well who is she trying to be?&rdquo; or &ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous, where&rsquo;d she even come up with that?&rdquo; Suppose I come into work and I was dressed raggedy. People may say, &ldquo;Justin must be tired from working so hard.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wow, he must he&rsquo;s a hard worker!&rdquo; If a women came to work dressed raggedy, all of a sudden people would say, &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s not trying hard enough.&rdquo; These double standards have to cease to exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that behind every woman is a tribe of successful women who have her back. Real women are classy, strong, independent, loyal, and lovable. That&#39;s one thing about women that we have to recognize. We don&#39;t recognize their strength enough. When we talk about women we always talk about meekness, weakness, or being submissive. No, no, no, no, women are strong, beautiful, fearless, and they are wise. We have to start changing the facet of how we view women. I am constantly reminded about how we just use women. We pimp them out every day by over sexualization. We can&rsquo;t even sell cheeseburgers without a woman being in a tiny shorts or a bikini while holding a burger, worse yet, serving it to a man. When did you need someone in a thong to sell a cheeseburger? Even though Eleanor Roosevelt once said &ldquo;No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.&rdquo; it still happens. You spend generations being told that you are less than and let me know if you feel inferior. Women have to put in extra effort to maintain their strength, dignity, and pride. It&rsquo;s terrible how we have to make women feel so incomplete just so as men can feel complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though people think about the feminist movement negatively, I don&#39;t believe all feminists are like that. People say, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re too extreme, walking around burning their bras, saying that men are horrible.&rdquo; I think feminism is about the equality of everybody. If there weren&rsquo;t men in this world who were trying to downgrade women and make women feel less then, women wouldn&rsquo;t feel so incomplete. That&rsquo;s not to say that women need men to feel complete, because they don&#39;t. There are a lot of strong, independent women that don&#39;t need men at all and just want to inspire people and aspire to be the best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this world, we have women living in constant fear. I remember when I told my friends that I went to another country by myself. I remember my female friends saying, &ldquo;Man, that must be really nice to do that.&rdquo; I began thinking to myself, &ldquo;You have the money, you have the time, why can&#39;t you go?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a woman; I could never travel to another country by myself. It&rsquo;s not safe.&rdquo; I really didn&#39;t understand my privilege as a man until I understood that point. There are times that I recognize my privilege as a man. But then there are also times that I recognize I don&rsquo;t have privilege due to my Blackness. It&#39;s a shame that my friends can&#39;t do the same things that I do just because they&#39;re women. Then I think about my sisters, are there double standards that I have for them as women? Do I want them not to go to certain places or be with certain people? Yet, as a man, I could be with anybody I want wherever I want. No one questions me about the places that I go. No one questions when I go, who I go with, whether I leave my drink alone, or whether I&rsquo;m going by myself. No one ever thinks any of those things. Our women are queens and we have to treat them as such.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a great deal of issues that women are dealing with on a daily basis. I reflect on the fact that women are always expected to compete with one another. We spoke about women versus women in a previous chapter. This is a reality for some women, especially in the workplace. Workplace discrimination happens, which in and of itself is terrible. But on top of that, women are forced to compete with each other for the little success and opportunities available for them. Women shouldn&rsquo;t be a default or an afterthought. They should be respected for what they can offer and treated fairly compared to their male counterparts. On top of that, why are we not consulting women in this country when we&#39;re making choices that directly affect them? Decisions are made on healthcare, health insurance, justice system, or even making choices about the underrepresentation of women in politics. Women are mostly left out of these conversations. We need to be going to the source. Women should be giving us insight in regards to the human trafficking epidemic, women in prison, health care, reproductive rights, and the wage gap. Why are we not inviting women to this table? How are men making <em>all</em> of these choices? Why did men get to make the laws about sick time, access to health care, or even maternity leave? We don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with women who are sick, we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with a woman&rsquo;s body after they deliver a baby, or while they are pregnant. I think as a man, we need to understand that we cannot have life and life cannot be produced without women. Therefore, that alone just shows the power and significance that women have in this world. But again, their worth is not determined by reproduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with this, our issues are always the same: violence against women, rape, and sexual assault. These terrible scenarios are sometimes caused by intimate partners; people that say that they love them but have the nerve to exploit them, abuse them, and treat them like objects. It&#39;s not even in the federal resources to convict the men who are doing this. Hundreds of men get away with it. When we look at the continuing gender wage gap, men are still making a good deal more money than women for the same exact job. I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s still a thing. I know anti-gender wage gap individuals will say, &ldquo;Well no, it&#39;s because women are choosing jobs that are way below what men are paid.&rdquo; When I looked at the disaggregated information, I saw that most HR departments are made up of women. So you&#39;re saying that every single woman who&#39;s in HR have all conspired together to sit there and say, &ldquo;Let&#39;s make sure that the women don&#39;t make as much money as men?&rdquo; I don&#39;t think so. It doesn&rsquo;t happen that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we think about the poverty, hunger, and homelessness and we only see men. They don&#39;t really show a lot of women who are homeless; it&rsquo;s just not a good look. But there are a lot of women who are, and this includes women with children. Usually, the caregivers, or people who give homeless people a place to live are women also.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think about the treatment of women in prison and the groping that occurs during the body search &ndash; that is sexual assault. Correctional Officers are committing rape and it&rsquo;s not being taken seriously nor are they are not being held accountable. There are 75% more women who are taken into sex slavery and human trafficking than men. Why are we not speaking up for these issues? Is it because as men, it&rsquo;s not important to us since it&rsquo;s not happening to us? Is it because we devalue women? Is it because that as long as it&rsquo;s not happening to the women that we love or care about, it&#39;s okay? &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the biggest issue here lies with the underrepresentation of women in the political sector. Whenever you turn on the TV, you see cisgender men, most likely also heterosexual, white, and Christian. You don&#39;t see a lot of women in Congress. I think a shift is now starting to happen, but we don&rsquo;t see a lot of women in politics, not because they don&rsquo;t want to be there, but because of barriers. We need women in there, representing and providing insight. We need them to be the ones making the laws. We need them to be the ones putting bills on the table because they&#39;re intelligent, strong and fair. They should be the ones making laws about women&rsquo;s health and access to care. &nbsp;Men can&#39;t speak to this; men should remain silent on these issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s even discrimination in academia in regards to how much female professors are making. Let&#39;s just look at the students &ndash; there are vastly more females in higher education. Yet, they still have to fight for equal rights access to resources. Look at the fields women are going into. People think that women are just going into nursing or education. There are plenty of women in math, sciences, and technology fields. It&rsquo;s really important that we highlight and show women that these areas exists for their future. It starts when they are born. There&rsquo;s a mold that is set up from birth. I said this before, when boys are born, they get the blue color and girls get the pink color. Those colors come with expectations. Women are supposed to be meek, kind, and nurturing. Women should smile, be hospitable, and act like a lady. I don&rsquo;t think that women should start acting like a lady until they&rsquo;re treated like a lady. Women are second class citizens in America. The only time that I can recall in my history that being a woman was beneficial was when the Titanic was sinking and they let the women and children go first. That&rsquo;s pretty much it. And that was only the women and children that were in upper class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women&#39;s interests are also devalued. Anytime a woman brings up something that&#39;s important to them, in society&#39;s eyes it&#39;s not important. We also criticize them for not being some ideal form of a woman that someone decided was true one day. They come in different shapes, skin tones, and sizes, with different hair textures, backgrounds, experiences, and sexual orientations. We can&rsquo;t expect all women to be a size zero. A number doesn&rsquo;t determine your worth or beauty. All women are beautiful. Women don&#39;t need men to tell them that they&#39;re beautiful in order for them to feel that self-worth. That&#39;s why it&#39;s called self-worth. So women, if you&#39;re reading this text, I want you to know that your value is not based upon what society determines. Your value is not based is not based on what others think, whether that is your crush, partner, parent, teacher, or whoever. Your value is based on you! We need women to start taking charge and start understanding their worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t expect some women to represent all women; it&#39;s not the same. Do I wish all women had the same attitude as a Beyonc&eacute;? Because it seems like all women always look at Beyonc&eacute; when it comes to the women empowerment movement. Look, this is not a shot at Beyonc&eacute;, and I know I&#39;m going to get a lot of crap for this and I don&rsquo;t care; I&rsquo;m going to call it like it is. I think Beyonc&eacute; is a great singer. I think she&#39;s a great performer. I think she&#39;s beautiful. I think she&#39;s definitely talented, and a great entertainer but that&#39;s what she is. She&rsquo;s an entertainer. I think that she truly does believe in the things that she does and says but I don&#39;t think that she was really talking about any of these issues until she saw that she could market from it. I think that when pop was popular, Beyonc&eacute; did pop. Then she saw the woman&#39;s movement and moved to that arena. I don&#39;t think Beyonc&eacute; really started even talking about women issues or race until that became popular &ndash; then all of a sudden she came out with <em>Lemonade</em>. Everybody started talking about how Beyonc&eacute; is so innovative. Was she innovative ladies when she was talking about being &ldquo;Bootylicious?&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve got to make sure that we&#39;re not relying on celebrities to speak for us because one set of women do not represent the rest. I&#39;m not saying this as a shot to Beyonc&eacute;. No shade on the Beehive or Queen B!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a lot of different people that do this. They will jump on the bandwagon when something is important or popular. They will speak to the issues that you all think are important. Why are we waiting for people to speak for us? Why aren&#39;t we speaking out on issues that affect us on a daily basis? We need to all come together &ndash; not just celebrities, not just people that are empowered &ndash; it&#39;s about all of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Women&rsquo;s March on Washington (and everywhere else that we marched) of 2017, had men and women show up. We had people who were transgender show up. We had people with disabilities show up. We had people from different sexual orientations, races, ethnicities, languages, and religions show up. All of those people are important. We, as the people, need to decide how this country is going to be. We, as the people, have the power. Yes, the government ultimately makes the rules and we in the end have to follow those rules, but it&rsquo;s up to us to choose who gets placed in those seats!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We went through the 2017 election talking about change, but did change really happen? Did people really come out? I think people fear change. I think change scares people. I think Hillary being in the White House and her potentially being the first woman president scared many people. People fear the unknown. People fear what they don&#39;t understand. I don&#39;t have a problem with a woman in office being the Commander-in-Chief as long as she can do the job. The job of the President is to represent America, in the right way, not their own way. That&rsquo;s why I could never be president of the United States because I would be too controversial. Why would you be controversial, Justin? I&rsquo;m glad you asked! I would be controversial because I wouldn&#39;t make it about me. It&rsquo;s not about me. I think a lot of the times we ask these presidential candidates what their personal take is on stuff. In my opinion, as the president you don&#39;t get the luxury to say what your personal opinion is; it&#39;s not about you, it&#39;s about the country. If it&#39;s not moving America forward then it shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue. They&rsquo;re asked, &ldquo;Well what do you think about this?&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t matter what they think &ndash; what does America think? How is that pushing our country forward? We ask these presidential candidate all the time about their thoughts on marriage equality. Who cares about their opinion! They represent the opinions of the people, they don&rsquo;t get to just amplify their own beliefs. Are there gay people in America? Yes! Do they need healthcare benefits that they can only get from a spouse once they&#39;re married? Absolutely! Should they get the same benefits? Absolutely! Are they American? Yes! &nbsp;Do they deserve to have their union respected? Yes! Then let&#39;s push it forward. What about these people who are illegal immigrants? Were they born here? Do they have families that want to come over here? Do we want to continue to make sure that America is the land of the free? Absolutely! Does that push America forward? Yes! Then let&#39;s do that. Moving forward has to be our main focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know I&#39;m making this issue short and sweet. I know there are a lot that goes into politics &ndash; the rules, the red tape, and of course a lot money. What I&#39;m saying is, sometimes we just make things too difficult. We are so scared. It&rsquo;s not that deep. We do the same thing in student affairs. They say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been doing it like this forever so we should just continue to do it like this.&rdquo; No people! We&rsquo;ve got to change how we&#39;re doing things. It can&#39;t continue to stay the same way forever. If it stays like this, then, we get stuck. We wonder why the number of sexual assaults haven&#39;t gone down. We wonder why women don&#39;t feel that they&#39;re represented. We wonder why women don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re valued and why they don&rsquo;t think their worth is the same as a man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to change our terminology. Our terminology is terrible. We chide men by telling them they throw like a girl, they&rsquo;re acting like a girl, and to stop whining like a girl. Those types of comments are insinuating that women are less than and that being compared to a woman is a negative thing. We can&#39;t teach our boys to talk like that. We can&#39;t teach our young men that this is okay. Again, let&rsquo;s go back to some of the other comments. Men, how many times are you told some of the things women hear daily? Things like that your clothing or body is distracting your classmates or even your teacher? You&rsquo;re wearing too much makeup; you look like a clown. You men complain about anything. You&rsquo;re too skinny; eat a burger. You&rsquo;re too fat; eat a piece of broccoli. You&rsquo;ll want kids someday. Keep your legs together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I get upset when I hear men say, &ldquo;There are some issues that women go through that I am just glad I don&#39;t have to go through.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not okay. I shouldn&#39;t be able to be on this side of the issues and be okay with it. No, no, no, no! We need to be advocates for women. We need to be champions for women. We need to make sure that they are safe. We need to make sure that they are getting an equal say and equal pay. There needs to be equality all around the board. We, as men, cannot be the ones that say that. We, as men, need to shut up, take a seat and figure out what women need to rise up, then support it in any way we can. Keep in mind that they don&rsquo;t need us to success, but they need us to get of the way and give them a chance. People might be reading this thinking, &ldquo;Justin is trippin&rsquo;!&rdquo; Sadly, I wish I was. When you&#39;ve had someone special in your life who was is female and they have been discriminated against due to their gender or have been passed up for opportunities because they&#39;re women you need to say something. Or if you have women in your life that has been downgraded because they&rsquo;re a women, or been assaulted because they&rsquo;re women, say something. It&rsquo;s no longer just a women&rsquo;s issue. It becomes an everybody issue. And, until it becomes an everybody issue for everyone, we won&#39;t be able to move forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have done sexual assault awareness training at many universities. I think it&#39;s really important to talk about those things. If you ever get an opportunity, you need to see the <em>Hunting Ground</em>, a documentary about rape on college campuses. It is going to make you angry and sick to your stomach, at least that was my reaction &ndash; but you need to see it. It&#39;s about women who are trying to get an education and they&#39;ve been sexually assaulted or raped. These institutions, that I am sure they are paying a lot of money to be at, didn&rsquo;t support them, and some didn&rsquo;t even believe them! I cannot imagine being assaulted, in and of itself, but then going to the people who are supposed to protect you, keep you safe, and fight for you, and they call you a liar. Even more disgusting and despicable, they try to cover it up to protect the institution&#39;s reputation. For that person to go through all of that pain of reliving the situation or becoming retraumatized just to be called a liar and not receive justice is heartbreak. Just abhorrent behaviors by educational leaders. I think about some of these situations where it was the star quarterback raping a woman. They had entire stadiums boo these women &ndash; all because they had hurt their precious quarterback&rsquo;s reputation. Look, I love football more than anybody. I&#39;m a huge Philadelphia Eagles fan but if the Philadelphia Eagles ever, ever allowed a sexual assault to be downgraded, erased, or be seen as acceptable, that would be the day that my jersey&rsquo;s went in the trash where they belong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took a gender studies course in undergrad. We talked about the women&#39;s suffrage movement, and I remembering thinking &ldquo;Wow, that word sounds like women suffering.&rdquo; After that class, I learned that the suffrage movement was about women gaining the right to vote. As a society, if we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, we&rsquo;ll sign up for anything. We&rsquo;ll sign up for what we think is popular. We&rsquo;ll sign up for the things that we can bandwagon for. One of my assignments for that class was to do a project on women&rsquo;s suffrage. I decided to walk around my campus with a petition to end women&#39;s suffrage; it was really fascinating assignment. I walked around with my clipboard and pen asking people if they supported ending women&rsquo;s suffrage. My position sounded good! Let me tell you, 151 people signed that petition to end women&rsquo;s suffrage. Just like Pok&eacute;mon, gotta catch them all, all 150! Anyone will sign up for something that&#39;s good or at least that they think is good. All I did was go out and say, &ldquo;Hey let&rsquo;s end women&rsquo;s suffrage; it&rsquo;s a terrible thing.&rdquo; And even though they had good intentions, ultimately, they supported the wrong thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that&#39;s the same thing that happened in the 2017 election. I think that many people were scared and I think that many people were trying to do what was best for America, in their own way. Some people believe that if you voted for Donald Trump you are racist. I don&rsquo;t believe that. I think people made the best decisions based on their own knowledge. Come on, when you know better, you do better. Again, I don&rsquo;t think that people who voted for Donald Trump are racist. I just think that people who heard him speak so nastily and showed signs of misogyny, homophobia, Islamophobia, and all those other things, just didn&rsquo;t find them to be deal breakers. They weren&#39;t an end all. Again, we have to ensure that people have the right knowledge and are knowledgeable before making these decisions. Regardlessly, women still have to persist even though they have all these odds stacked against them; they still have to move forward. They still have to continue to press on. They don&#39;t have the ability to say, &ldquo;Well I&#39;m just going to stop now.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your dreams aren&rsquo;t big enough to scare you, then they&#39;re not big enough. Women are big dreamers and I love seeing women encourage, support, and empower other women. It needs to happen more. And now, we need to shift that. We need men to encourage, support, and empower women. Why, because we are all humans and we are all valuable &ndash; sex or gender shouldn&#39;t determine your worth in this society. Yes, we as men can help lift women up and encourage them, but women are strong enough to do that on their own. We just need to step aside and give them a fair opportunity. If we just keep making women fight to be heard or respected, we&#39;re wasting their valuable energy. Energy that they can be using to make a difference in this world instead of being wasted just trying to get a seat at the table. Just think, where would we be if women were at an equal playing field from the start? Would we already have a cure for cancer? Would there be an end to global warming? Would our people have access to resources they need to survive? Would the world be a better place? Limiting women&#39;s voices limits the possible outcomes too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An empowered woman is an amazing being, beyond measure &ndash; strong, ambitious, and beautiful. As a man, I want to empower women. One day, if I have a son, I want him to empower women. I know, it&rsquo;s not men&rsquo;s responsibility to do this &ndash; women are powerful and self-sufficient. But I think it&rsquo;s important for men to be on their side, be their ally, and support them. We know women don&rsquo;t <em>need </em>a man; if anything men <em>need</em> women! I don&rsquo;t know if anyone else sees this the way I do because I know growing up as a Christian, we heard different. We were told &ldquo;Well God made man first; he made a woman from a man.&rdquo; I just think it&#39;s so interesting how God made a woman. He didn&#39;t make women from a man&rsquo;s butt, so therefore we shouldn&rsquo;t just sit down and completely squat on all their issues. No, we need to treat them with the respect and dignity that they deserve. God didn&rsquo;t make women from feet, therefore we shouldn&rsquo;t be stomping on their ideas, dreams, and aspirations. God didn&rsquo;t make them from any other body part except for the ribs. The ribs are very important &ndash; the ribs are what protect all of the vital organs keeping you alive. This shows that we need women to keep us alive! We need women to continue to help the human race thrive. It&#39;s about time as a society that we really examine what it&rsquo;s like to be a woman. Sometimes as a man, it&#39;s hard to be comfortable in our own skin. We&rsquo;re taught our whole lives to be strong, don&#39;t show any tears, and be a man. Then, by the time we meet a woman (for those who are heterosexual), we hear women say &ldquo;I wish I had a man who could show some emotion.&rdquo; By adulthood, we have already suppressed this in order to be masculine. It&rsquo;s the same thing for women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to just be able to continue to provide solid and inclusive education. We need to be able to push women forward so that when a man tells a woman she can trust him, she can actually believe him and not be afraid. The fear that women have for men is disheartening. Men, don&#39;t you feel that? The fact that women are scared to walk at night because men are around, that doesn&#39;t bother you? It doesn&#39;t bother you that women have to walk down the street every day and get cat&ndash;called and treated as sexual object? Those things don&rsquo;t bother you? Well, if it doesn&rsquo;t, you&#39;re really enjoying the privilege of being a man. When you know yourself and you&#39;re empowered and you accept yourself, you become invincible; and there are a lot of invincible women out there! To the women that are out there doing the good work &ndash; standing up, speaking up, and supporting the movement - I salute you! It is not a job for the weary, weak, or faint of heart. I hope that you are encouraged and that you continue to do the great things you are already doing. We&#39;ve got to do our part too!</p>', '2020-05-29 13:32:19', '2020-05-29 13:32:19', NULL);

(11, 19, '10', '<p>This chapter focuses on the direction in which student affairs is heading. I will be posing to the reader several questions that I often ask audiences when I am conducting training. Perhaps these questions will evoke some emotions about how you truly feel about your work within the student affairs field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think like a lot of people in this field, when I was in my undergrad I had no idea I was going to go into student affairs. I started off as a Psychology major but ended up landing in Communications. As a Communications major, I learned a great deal about the business side of communications as well as marketing and especially public relations. This is what really interested me &ndash; the drive to get a message across and the ability to stand in front of people and do public speaking. It was exactly what I wanted. That major was made for me. Yet, I was still unsatisfied. Throughout my time as an undergrad, I had the ability to be part of numerous different student organizations. I worked with the Student Government Association and was a Resident Assistant for three years. I worked with student orientation and in the public relations office as a student leader. I was involved in a lot of student activities and probably every facet of the institution outside of my academic requirements. It came to my final semester of my senior year and it was time for me to figure out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Like a lot of students, I didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do. I had come to discover the harsh reality that I had gotten a degree in something I completely did not want to do. I couldn&rsquo;t see myself sitting behind a desk every day writing press releases. I didn&rsquo;t want to be on TV hosting shows. I didn&#39;t want to be a voice on radio. So, at this point, I had a worthless degree. Had I used my degree to my fullest potential, I could have gone out there and done anything I wanted, but now I had a job that I didn&#39;t want to do and I felt stuck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever felt like that, putting all your hopes, dreams, passions, and ideas into something that didn&#39;t produce much fruit? I felt like a seedless tree. Like a tree that has grown to its fullest potential, but without seeds. If more seeds can&rsquo;t fall from the tree to the ground, then when that trees longevity is over, there is no new tree to blossom in its place. At this point in the game, I had no idea what I what I could do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was pretty close with the Director of Public Relations at Slippery Rock University and we had several talks; she was a great mentor of mine. I also had a great relationship with one of the Directors of Admissions. I remember them telling me that it was clear as day what I wanted to do for the rest of my life and that everybody could see it but me. I said, &ldquo;Well what is it? What am I supposed to do?&rdquo; I had no clue here. I had a full scholarship and I used it on a degree in something that I&rsquo;m not sure I wanted to do long term. It was a great fall back but it wasn&#39;t something I was passionate about. It wasn&rsquo;t something that I could see myself really making a difference with and changing people&#39;s lives. They informed me, &ldquo;Justin, you&rsquo;ve been involved in all of these different things on campus. You definitely want to work with students for the rest of your life. You need to go into student affairs.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Student affairs...what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; That is when I learned what this field was &ndash; supporting students, helping them through their journey, and encouraging the development outside of the classroom. I said, &ldquo;Whatttt!?&rdquo; It was like everything just clicked &ndash; the stars shone and my eyes lit up. I thought, all these things that I&#39;ve been doing for my four years was not a waste. BINGO! That&rsquo;s exactly what I wanted to do. So that&rsquo;s how student affairs came about for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door opened up for me to go to Indiana University of Pennsylvania &ndash; one of the top ten schools in the country for student affairs. Many of my professors had written the books that we were learning from. It was a high priority school that had a great reputation, a lot of networks, and really challenged their students. The program benefited me and pushed me to my peak academic potential. It was not an easy program at all &ndash; the professors definitely did not accept subpar work. You had to really push yourself to your fullest potential. It wasn&#39;t one of those programs that you could sleep through. The program focused heavily on student affairs theory and practice, as well as outside of classroom internships and practicums. I was deeply immersed in the framework and the theories that back our practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now being in the field, I realize that that 60% of my job had nothing to do with theory and had nothing to do with practice. But that 60% of my job, in the real world, was actually answering emails. How many of you feel like that? How many of you feel like the majority of your job is answering emails? Or going to committee meetings that could have been an email? When people ask what you do during the day, you say, &ldquo;I answer emails.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s exactly how I felt. I started getting a different take as to what student affairs actually was. But really though, student affairs is important and necessary because these professionals are helping the students develop outside of the classroom. Academic affairs can only do that to an extent because they see students for 1-2 hours a day, if even that much. We see them for the rest of the time &ndash; in their social lives, when they&rsquo;re home, and when they are navigating the world. We&#39;re helping them with their development not only professionally but also personally. Overall, we&#39;re helping these students grow so that they can go out into the global society. Look at the type of students that we&rsquo;re getting. We have students that are developed and told that they need to raise their hand before they go to the bathroom. Now we have them in higher education and we tell them, &ldquo;Here you go, pick what you want to do for the rest of your life.&rdquo; Talk about mind-boggling! Anyone out there in student affairs world that doesn&rsquo;t know what they want to do for the rest of their life? I thought so!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the students arrived to campus, we see where they are developmentally. So often I see students who are at college because they &ldquo;supposed to be&rdquo; or because their parents told them they had to go. They are here because it is just what you do after high school, after all, that&rsquo;s what all their siblings, cousins, neighbors, and so forth did. Many students don&#39;t even realize that you can find a lot of next steps without going to a four-year college, and that perfectly fine. Students still even have false realities of college. Ridiculous things like, &ldquo;If I get hit by a bus while I&rsquo;m on campus, I&rsquo;ll get free tuition.&rdquo; or &ldquo;If my roommate dies, I&rsquo;ll get a 4.0 that semester.&rdquo; Students, I&rsquo;m afraid these concepts don&#39;t exist, they&#39;re urban legends. But, developmentally students need us and we need them. We have this crazy thing in student affairs called <em>in loco parentis</em>. Yes, we&#39;re in lieu of parents, but at the same time we are not these students&#39; parents. Our job is to not make decisions for them but to help guide them so that they can make effective decisions for themselves. It&rsquo;s a difficult task in student affairs, because you make strong, close bonds and relationships with students, but you need to let them figure some stuff out on their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colleagues, think about this. If I asked you right now to pick your favorite student, what would you honestly tell them about the real world? If you could, would you shield them from it? It completely goes against our practice, but if you had the ability, would you exercise it? I know that we don&rsquo;t go out there searching for favorite students, but you know you&#39;ve got them. You know, the ones that come in and make you feel like you alive, like you are accomplishing your goals of supporting students. These are the students and the relationships that brought you into this field. Because if you&rsquo;re doing it to be a millionaire, you&rsquo;re definitely looking in the wrong place. No, we came into this because we care about the students. The students give us the drive and the passion to work the long hours and fight through the stress. We actually love our students and some of them we actually do refer to as our kids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To me, student affairs has made big shift. The shift is that we used to be present to work with students, to help students. Today, it seems like in student affairs, we&#39;re working for students. What do you mean by that, Justin? Well, students paid their money and we&#39;re here to provide them services. We&#39;re no longer here to help them grow, develop, and become the individuals that are going to change tomorrow. No, they pay us and we work for them. We provide a service to them and anything that they need, we&#39;re here to provide. We are dealing with millennial students here &ndash; later millennials though, because I am also a millennial. These are the students that always had cellphones and didn&#39;t have to struggle through dial-up internet. The majority of these students were born when iPads were already around, Wi-Fi was readily available, and everything is instant and reliable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of these students feel very entitled &ndash; anything they ask for they should receive without hard work involved. This is the generation of participation trophies And you know what? We&rsquo;re also dealing with their helicopter parents who also think that we work for them as well because &ldquo;they pay our salary.&rdquo; Funny, I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone&rsquo;s parents name on my check, have you? Those sobering concepts can make any student affairs professional wonder why they got into the field in the first place. Many professionals unfortunately lose their passion because of things like this they deter from our mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me ask you this: how many of you know someone in this field who doesn&rsquo;t belong here, or at least not anymore? I know that you all know somebody; that person who sits in that corner office and is supposed to contribute to student affairs initiatives but doesn&rsquo;t. The person who&rsquo;s been riding the coattails of the institution, getting paychecks each week, but not providing anything new. The person who&rsquo;s burned out. The person that&#39;s been doing the same thing over and over and over again for the last twenty years. How dare you ask them to change anything! Yes, these people do exist. Those are the people that prevent us from having changes and innovations in our field. Oh God, not change at an institution...we&#39;ve been doing it like this forever, we shouldn&#39;t change things. How many times have you heard, &ldquo;I love your idea, I think what you said was very beneficial and I think it&#39;s something that we would love to incorporate. But, unfortunately, right now we do not have the budget for that.&rdquo; How many of you have heard &ldquo;We&#39;ve always done it this way, why would you want to change it? Why fix what isn&rsquo;t broken?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I know our student population is growing and the budget is decreasing, let&rsquo;s just stay the course.&rdquo; Unfortunately, this is a sad but true reality for professionals in the field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We sincerely need to look at this field from a new angle. We have higher student enrollment at most universities but fewer resources and smaller budgets to accommodate them. Quite frequently, institutions will call me to do professional development training. At one such institution, they were working with a model for the development and leadership of students that they&#39;ve been using since 1994. Yet in 1994, this institution had 10,000 students. Today this institution has grown to almost 25,000. If our students are changing, growing, and developing, and the culture of our country is changing, shouldn&rsquo;t we be changing alongside them? Are we so hung up on institutional mission goals and outcomes that we can&#39;t see the need for change?&rdquo; The mission statements and the overall goals of our institutions should be changing, as our students are changing, as society is changing, as the job market is changing, as our environment is changing, and as the diversity rate in our country is changing. The greatest resistance to change is fear. What if it doesn&rsquo;t work? Am I willing to take the blame for the initiative going south? My opinion is if it doesn&rsquo;t work, you can always go back to the old model, but at least for now, try something new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those professionals in the field who are always complaining, have you made strides to change? If not, it&rsquo;s time you gave up your seat to those who really want to foster change in the institution. Again, what spaces are you making for change?&nbsp; If a student came to your office right now, would they feel that your office or your particular department welcomes diversity? Is it an inclusive environment? The value of any department is how it runs and operates with the students when the leader is not present. Without you at the helm, would your office fall apart? Again, I know we work at different types of institutions: private schools, public schools, religiously affiliated schools, and so on. &nbsp;Nonetheless, do your students carry the heart of your department and carry the heart of the mission of the institution? Or without you would your department even exist? Are you discouraged? If you answered yes to any of those questions, let me tell you, you&#39;re not the only person that feels like this. If you&rsquo;re unsure why you got into the field in the first place, maybe it&rsquo;s time to reevaluate your purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past ten years, I&#39;ve traveled to almost 400 institutions and the complaints are still the same. I&rsquo;ve even been to institutions that change their principals in order to increase enrollment. One institution I worked with was supposed to have 5,000 incoming freshmen, and by the spring they only had 2,800. So, they accepted anyone and everyone, just to meet the quota. The quality of their students dropped and, therefore, the institutional value and the institutional culture changed. The institution isn&rsquo;t even the same place because they lowered their admission standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;re saying that you&rsquo;re discouraged? Why? Is that because there&#39;s not enough money? There will never be enough money at any institution. In fact, right now, I&#39;m sure somewhere at your institution they are finding a way to cut something. So, what are student affairs professionals, who are already not getting paid enough, supposed to do? And, now they&#39;re cutting your budget which will require you to work more without extra pay? Many professionals feel as though they don&#39;t have support from their institution or even their department. To those reading who are managers or supervisors, do you really support the individuals who work under you or do they feel as if they&#39;re just another employee? Can they come to you and tell you what&#39;s going on, not only professionally, but also personally? Or do the people who work for you, put on a mask and tap dance around in order to not ruffle feathers? Are you truly elevating the greatness of the people who work for you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student affairs professionals have greatness in them; they are multifaceted and talented. A lot of people who are in residence life also have an interest in multiculturalism. I know many individuals who work in career services but also own and operate their own companies. I know several professionals who also work in student recreation, the student union, Greek life, admissions office, in the women&#39;s and gender equity, the LGBTQIA office, who all have outside interests. They all have additional roles with some aspect of higher education. Yet, they&#39;re not allowed to do these jobs or talk about them at their own institutions. Why? You can&#39;t be a prophet in your own land. If we have in-house talent, why are we outsourcing presentations, workshops, and seminars that help encourage our students? The bottom line is: as student affairs professionals, we don&rsquo;t always support one another. One reason we don&rsquo;t support one another is due to over-the-top competition. Kirk Franklin, a popular gospel singer, posted on Instagram, &ldquo;Humility is not born from insecurity but in the confidence of letting others go first because they can&rsquo;t take seats God didn&rsquo;t give!&rdquo; All the time I hear: &ldquo;my proposal got accepted at this conference; I got this much professional development money; look at all these side projects I&#39;m doing; I&rsquo;m on 12 committees.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s great! Congratulate them! Don&rsquo;t put them down. Our profession has one of the biggest water cooler gossip circles I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I&#39;ve never seen so many people get talked about for doing great things. Student affairs isn&rsquo;t a competition. I know everybody&#39;s trying to reach the top. People focus too much on doing this or that so that they will be great. But, at the end of the day, are you making a change at your institution? Are you affecting students&#39; lives? Those are the most important questions to ask yourself. Yes, we want to demonstrate that we are growing in our professional development in the hopes that one day, we can move up to assistant directors or directors. But that&rsquo;s not our main mission. That&rsquo;s not why we&#39;re here. We&#39;re here for the students. Have you lost sight?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need supportive supervisors, but we also need to support one another! Most professionals I speak with tell me their successes are often looked down upon. I see a lot of people who get awards at conferences, who are being recognized, who are doing great work; yet their institution knows nothing about it. Why do they need to hold it close to their chests? Because to be great inside your job <em>and</em> outside your job means that people are going to despise you. Our students even notice this. Because of the relationship students have with professionals, they sometimes know more about your institutional culture than you do. They know exactly what&#39;s happening behind closed doors and it bleeds into our student body. We can&#39;t have that because our offices and our institutions are supposed to be safe havens for students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, I remember having a conversation with a student from the LGBTQIA community who did not want to go home during spring break. The time came for us to close down the residence hall and the student said, &ldquo;Justin, honestly, I&rsquo;m not trying to be that person who gets fined, but do I really have to go home?&rdquo; When I asked why this student didn&rsquo;t want to go home, the student said, &ldquo;I can&#39;t be myself when I&#39;m at home. I&#39;m gay. My parents don&#39;t accept it.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Well home is home, right?&rdquo; This is when I was still learning about some perspectives. The student said, &ldquo;No, I don&#39;t consider my parent&rsquo;s house home. I consider this place my home.&rdquo; It was that day that I really understood that for some students, our institutions are more like &ldquo;home&rdquo; than their actual homes. For some students, we are their community. We are their backbone. We are their support system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some students don&rsquo;t have parental figures or adults to look up to, so we sometimes take on that role. I certainly understand <em>in loco parentis</em>, but the situation is what it is. We are dealing with complex students who have complex issues. But we can&rsquo;t lump them all together and treat them as though they all have the <em>same</em> issues. A lot of these students have some really raw talent, but they need direction. As an example, I had a student on my floor who was causing trouble not only for himself, but for every single person on the floor. Yet, he had a lot of raw talent. I finally sat down with him and asked him what he was involved with on campus. The student said, &ldquo;I do absolutely nothing!&rdquo; People that&rsquo;s exactly why we&rsquo;re here. The student simply wasn&rsquo;t involved; he was floundering. I remember looking this student right in their face and saying, &ldquo;If you only used your powers for good, you would be an influential leader.&rdquo; This student went on to be the Student Government Association president and governed during his undergraduate career with pride, dignity, and excellence. How much are we intentionally guiding them or are we simply issuing them citations over and over again without trying to get to the core of their behavior? Are we becoming so robotic that we know why students are coming into our office and we just give them what they want and head out the door? How many students did you see today? Do you know their names? Do you know their backgrounds? Do you know where they&#39;re from? Do you know what their likes or their dislikes are? Or did you just give them an answer they could have easily found online on their own?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some universities have eliminated student affairs departments from their institutions. The thinking goes along the line of we have websites and all these other resources. Do students really need us for their growth and development? Ask yourself that question because there&#39;s intention and intentionality. I told you before that there are many times as a cisgender, heterosexual, Black male, I am like a unicorn in student affairs. Meaning, any time there&#39;s an issue with men they send them to me. Any time there&#39;s an issue with students of color they send them to me. Any time there&#39;s an issue with heterosexual students, they send them to me. Why? Is it because I can better relate to those students? In some situations, I do have a better understanding and dynamic with our students of color and sending them to me is a good idea. However, it doesn&#39;t mean that my other colleagues are not as equipped to handle these situations. Can you imagine if every single time I had an issue with a student, I sent them to another office? There would be absolutely no way that people would be able to do their jobs. Just like there&rsquo;s no way I would be able to do my job. We have to go back to what&rsquo;s most important &ndash; student development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have to learn to not take ourselves so seriously. I remember very early on when I was a Resident Director, I really wanted students to listen to me. So, I tried scaring them; it didn&rsquo;t work. I tried giving incentives; it didn&#39;t work. I tried disciplining them; it didn&#39;t work. During my first year, students on the third floor of my building would trash it &ndash; over and over again. No matter how much I whined, sent e-mails, had judicial conferences, met with students individually, caught them on camera, gave them fines, the floor would still get trashed. I was the director. They should listen to me, right? I have all the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>power. It wasn&#39;t until our custodial worker, Miss Sue, got involved that students actually listened. Why was that? Because as a Resident Director, I was perceived as the authority figure, but Miss Sue paid attention to my students. She knew what rooms they lived in. She knew about their classes and asked them how they were doing. She asked how their families and pets were doing. The students saw how much work and effort Miss Sue put into keeping the floor clean that there was no way they would continue to trash that floor. Why? Because Miss Sue developed a relationship with them, they respected her and therefore, she had credibility. When she told them to not dirty up the floor, they didn&rsquo;t. It had nothing to do with my power and my authority. What does that show you? It conveys multiple things. It demonstrates that as student affairs professionals, sometimes we need to take a backseat and understand that as employees of the institution we work for, we <em>all</em> are responsible for students&#39; growth and development. This is not just the responsibility of academic affairs or student affairs. Everyone, from the custodial worker all the way up to the president&rsquo;s office, have a responsibility to ensure these students are learning, growing, and developing. What does it also show you? It shows there are many people who are important at the institution who we overlook. When you see custodial workers at your institution, do you thank them? They work hard at their jobs every day, just like you! Maintenance workers, employees who provide the upkeep to the institution, same question, do you notice them? I know a lot of you probably complain about the IT services at your institution. Everyone probably thinks their institution&rsquo;s Wi-Fi is slow; it happens. Everyone thinks their dining hall food is tasteless; it happens. There are individuals who come in every single day, and they&#39;re not only serving the students, but they&#39;re also serving the employees. There&rsquo;s not one person who is more important than another. We are all in the business of supporting students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As student affairs professionals, are we looking at our Black employees for knowledge and insight? I know sometimes my colleagues ask me questions as if I represent the entire Black community, as if I hold the answer to all of their questions. &ldquo;Justin, I had a student who did this, what does this mean?&rdquo; No, it doesn&rsquo;t work like that. Yes, there are times when Black colleagues and Black student affairs professionals have insights into the Black student population that our colleagues don&rsquo;t. Guess what? That&rsquo;s okay. Again, that&rsquo;s when we talk about everybody being a part of the institution. At the same time, do not have your Black colleagues on speed dial just so you have a Black face or voice at your institution. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve been put on a search committee so they can check the &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; requirement box. I&rsquo;ve been on search committees that I wasn&#39;t even qualified for, but because I was Black, I met the quota.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This plight is something that most people of color experience not only inside their institution but outside of their institution as well. It&rsquo;s not enough that student affairs professionals, who have master&#39;s degrees and are supposed to be aware of their multicultural competence, come into the job and do the exact same thing that we&#39;re teaching our students not to do. When white my colleagues tell me, &ldquo;Well you can&rsquo;t feel like that because it didn&rsquo;t happen like that.&rdquo; Essentially, what they just told me is everything you just said is wrong, so shut up. Student affairs professionals, listen to me. It&rsquo;s very important that when your colleagues of color are speaking, you try very hard not to invalidate their experience. Just because you didn&#39;t go through it, you didn&#39;t hear it, and you didn&#39;t experience it, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not true. We need you to be able to support everyone at our jobs. If I perceive it, then it&rsquo;s my reality. Our colleagues with different sexual orientations, our colleagues with different religions, our colleagues of color, please don&#39;t invalidate their experiences. When you say, well it happened like this, if it happened like that, that&#39;s because that&#39;s how <em>you</em> experienced it. Everybody experiences things differently and everybody has to know their role and power. Do you know how many times I&#39;ve talked to students at the end of the semester and they told me they are transferring. When I ask them why, they say, &ldquo;Well director such and such said this to me, and I can&#39;t stand this institution.&rdquo; Do we truly recognize how important our words are when we speak to students? We&#39;re planting seeds that can grow for the rest of their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In chapter 1, you read how my high school counselor planted a very negative seed, but out of that negative seed, I was able to blossom, into a tree of success. Many people unfortunately carry these negative seeds for a lifetime because they don&rsquo;t have the resources or support to turn the negative into something positive. I&rsquo;ve had many situations where I just acknowledged students and said hello to them, very much like most of you do. Then later on, that student comes back to me and says, &ldquo;Thanks, you made my day when you spoke to me.&rdquo; There was a student I had once who had cerebral palsy, and I&#39;ll be honest, I had a very hard time understanding the student verbally because the palsy had affected her speech. What would normally be a three minute conversation was now a 25 minute conversation with her because it took that long for her to convey what she needed to say and for me to properly understand her. But, I intentionally took the time with that student and it made all the difference. She later came back with a letter that she wrote to me describing how important she felt at that moment in time and that at no other time at the institution, did she feel as if anybody took what she had to say seriously. She felt most people just patronized her by nodding their head at her and smiling. Take the intentional time. It works wonders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students don&#39;t need us to always tell them what to do. We&#39;re here to advise students, to point them in the right direction, and to give them a gentle push toward their destiny. We have to pay attention to our student&rsquo;s needs and wants first, but they are not our pet projects. Some of our students are actually spoiled and it would be helpful if we allowed them to figure out problems on their own, instead of hand holding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of our Black students feel as though white professionals don&#39;t care about them. Do they feel that way because it&rsquo;s true? Absolutely not. Well, if that&#39;s not true, why do students feel that way? The majority of the people in our profession care the same way about all of their students. As student affairs professionals, you have to stop owning things that have nothing to do with you personally. I hear, &ldquo;Well that student doesn&#39;t like me.&rdquo; It&#39;s not about you personally; it&rsquo;s about the culture your office is cultivating and portraying. And if the problem lies in the culture of your office, you have the power to change that!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, I remember speaking with the Director of Residence Life at a particular institution who was frustrated that he could not recruit students of color. He said, &ldquo;I don&#39;t understand it, Justin. We go to their offices of Multicultural Affairs, and we tell them about this great job. I take time out of my own schedule to go down there; yet, nobody ever wants to be a part of our department even though they get free room and board! I don&#39;t understand why we can&#39;t recruit students of color!&rdquo; So I asked him, &ldquo;How many students of color do you have on payroll right now?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Well, in our department, out of 121 students, we have five students of color.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Oh, that&#39;s interesting. Have you ever talked to those five students of color about their experience in your department?&rdquo; His immediate reply was, no. I said, &ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t know what their experience is like?&rdquo; He said, no. I then stated, &ldquo;What you&#39;re offering is a great opportunity and very generous at that! And so they should be so lucky to have it, right?&rdquo; He paused and said, &ldquo;Well, I didn&#39;t mean it like that.&rdquo; We then talked about the difference between intent and intentionality. I assured him &ldquo;I know you didn&rsquo;t mean it like that. I know that&rsquo;s not where your heart is. But, look at what students are seeing&ndash; &ldquo;Hello everyone, I&#39;m part of Residence Life and you should be a part of it because you&#39;re Black.&rdquo; That&#39;s not what you said, but that&#39;s what they heard.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the harmful messages which sometimes emanate from our offices, even messages which are meant to be positive but are perceived negatively, sometimes past experiences students of color have had are transferred to us. It&#39;s not about you personally. Many students of color are coming from areas where they experience racism, prejudice, and discrimination on a daily basis. It&rsquo;s only natural these students would bring those experiences with them to the institution. If students can&rsquo;t trust authority in places they call home, what makes you think they can trust authority on our campuses? It has nothing to do with you. It has to do with the experiences they already had. If you want to do something about it, change their perception, go the extra mile to impact a student&#39;s life. Take the initiative; don&rsquo;t expect them, who have less power than you, to make the first move. Most professionals don&rsquo;t take the initiative. They say, &ldquo;I feel uncomfortable.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to relate to those students. Those students don&#39;t come and talk to me.&rdquo; If those students don&#39;t come and talk to you, go talk to them! At your institution, where are all the students of color hanging out? How often are you there? Are you present or even remotely visible? Do they know who you are? Do they know what you&#39;re about?&nbsp; If they don&#39;t, you don&#39;t have any reason to complain <em>and</em> you&rsquo;re part of the problem. I think it&rsquo;s so funny when I see staff members with diversity stickers on their door claiming their offices are safe spaces; yet, no diverse students are ever there. We need to evaluate what those stickers are actually supposed to symbolize. It is not so much what our colleagues are doing, but more so, the attitude in how they are doing it. Attitude is everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to be involved in students&rsquo; lives, we also need to recognize new trends that students are participating in, especially new technology trends. Our students are constantly interacting with new technology and gadgets. As I am sitting here writing, I am also playing with a fidget spinner, the latest toy craze. There&#39;s always a new fad, a new app, a new dance move, a new clothing style, a new food, and a new Netflix show almost every day. It is a good idea to follow these new trends; it might make you more relatable. It&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;young people&rsquo;s thing.&rdquo; Take an interest in what our students are engaged in, even if you yourself could care less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relatability equals relationship and relationship equal growth in our students. It&#39;s a very simple equation. If you can meet students where they are, they can grow, develop, and mature into the students we want them to be. We have got to get out of this mentality that I can come to work from 9:00-5:00 and then live my own life. Yes, we have to have balance between work and home; yet, you can&rsquo;t pretend those students don&rsquo;t exist when you go home. I know student affairs professionals who work at predominantly Black institutions who come from the suburbs, do their teaching, do their training, and then go home. They make no impact on their students. They&rsquo;re just there to give them the required material, and that&#39;s it. I also know people who are supposed to work 40 hours each week, but they&#39;re working 60 or more hours. Why? Because they care. How many of you know, and it may be you, professionals who are working far more hours than they are putting down on their timesheet? You are putting far more time into the students than you are ever going to get paid for. But here we have a problem. It&#39;s on us to make sure we have work life balance. The best type of relationships I have with students is when I am authentic and real. When I was sad, I was sad. When I was mad, I was mad. When I was happy, I was happy. Yes, I remained professional, but I also showed students that I was someone they could relate to. I wasn&rsquo;t fake. They respected that and they grew from that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately a lot of individuals do not have sufficient multicultural competency. I talk to a lot of professionals who say they never had to take a diversity class while in their student affairs or higher education program. They never had to discuss issues of multiculturalism, cultural awareness, or diversity. How are our institutions allowing student affairs professionals to earn degrees without talking about low-income, first generation college students? This also includes or our international students, students of color, and those with language barriers. Most people tell me they talked about students with different sexual orientations but never talked about the high sexual assault rate that some of these students may experience. Their understanding is so basic, it&rsquo;s frightening. The only time they discussed students with disabilities is when referencing physical limitations, not mental illness nor learning disabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multicultural offices should not be the only offices on campus that work with diverse students. They are too numerous to be addressed by one office. And there&#39;s a danger in only having one source of information. When students only get one perspective and it creates a reason for certain students to only trust the opinion of that office. In truth multicultural issues are multidimensional and need to be addressed from various angles and different perspectives. Everybody should be working on diversity; however, this work is not easy, and it is usually only accomplished by a few. For those in the struggle, I understand. It&rsquo;s emotionally draining to be expected to not only fix every race-related incident on campus but to also educate the unenlightened. For example, most multicultural offices say they can&#39;t get white students into their offices. What kind of story is your office telling versus what kind of story are the white students hearing? Is your space free and open for everybody? Everyone says that it is, but is it truly <em>for</em> everyone? Is it a welcoming and inclusive area? I understand that sometimes it can&rsquo;t be. Our students of color do need a space where they can find strength, counsel, and family. However, we can&rsquo;t be the first ones pointing the finger when students who aren&rsquo;t of color don&rsquo;t show up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As any institution, we need to give students multiple perspectives. We need to ensure that we are staffed with diverse professionals. I often think about how many teachers of color I&rsquo;ve had in higher education. Let me tell you, I can count that number on one hand. Out of the approximately 100 classes I took during my undergrad and master&rsquo;s degree program, I probably had two professors of color. You think the students don&#39;t see this as well? Whenever I do see someone who looks like me at work, I have a Celie and Nettie patty cake moment from <em>The Color Purple</em>. Please look this up if you don&rsquo;t know what I mean. When Black professionals work in an institution, we&#39;re Black professionals. We have knowledge, and students respect us. When we go out into the real world, we&rsquo;re just Black. People don&#39;t look at us and say, &ldquo;Oh that person&#39;s educated.&rdquo; In fact, more times than not, when I tell people I have a master&#39;s degree, it&rsquo;s almost as if people want me to prove it! Or, they&rsquo;re just stunned and say, &ldquo;Oh wow! You&rsquo;re very educated. I didn&rsquo;t know that!&rdquo; As if my shade of color determines my educational level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do your students see you in the community? Are you embraced by the community? A lot of our students of color belong to many different student groups: the Latinx organization, the Black Student Union, the LGBTQIA student service centers, everything. Do they see you come to their programs? Do you go to their late night programming? Are you an ally? And before you answer, remember, being an ally isn&rsquo;t just having that little sticker on your door that says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for LGBTQIA rights&rdquo; or &ldquo;This is a safe space.&rdquo; An ally means you have a call to action to do something. Saying you&rsquo;re an ally means nothing; you have to BE an ally! BE PRESENT! Think about it. I could tell you I&#39;m a dingo or a walrus; does that mean that I am a dingo or a walrus? No, because nothing has changed about me. Change needs to happen on the inside before it can be reflected outwardly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to handle our defensiveness. Do you know how many times I try to talk to people about their understanding of diversity or their multicultural competence? They&rsquo;re always quick to say, &ldquo;Well, I understand this because I went to a diversity training...once.&rdquo; or &ldquo;But I have a black friend!&rdquo; We need to process constructive feedback and not become defensive. As a diversity trainer, do you think I say and do everything right? I am constantly checked and corrected, but it&rsquo;s alright, people are making me better. Iron sharpens iron. On the other hand, I had a colleague once who used to say, &ldquo;You gotta eat the meat and spit out the bones!&rdquo; In other words, if it doesn&#39;t apply to you, don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you realize you need to up your multicultural competence IQ, are you participating in webinars to help you do this? Are you looking at case studies so you can help mold your institution? It&#39;s all about sharpening your multicultural skills. I understand there aren&rsquo;t too many theories dealing with multiculturalism in our field. I also understand that most of our theories are gathered from different fields of study. None of that matters! We have to use the theories that we know and incorporate them into why we do what we do. Theory into practice people! Besides basing our practices on theory, we need to also rely on the experience and knowledge of others. If I don&#39;t know something, I&rsquo;m going to ask a professional who is competent in that area. As a male, for example, I don&rsquo;t know what it feels like to be a woman who was sexually assaulted. But, I may have a student who comes to me who was sexually assaulted. If I go to the gender equity office or the women&rsquo;s center at my institution, I can talk to one of my colleagues about the situation to gain insight so I can better relate to students in this situation &ndash; so I can assist and have a bigger impact. Be friendly with other departments and offices. You need them and they need you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many schools have asked me to do &ldquo;diversity audits&rdquo; or &ldquo;campus climate surveys.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll travel to an institution and talk to the president, down to the president&rsquo;s board, down to the president&#39;s cabinet. Then I&#39;ll go and talk to all the student affairs offices; that&rsquo;s where I learn about all the dirt that happens at the institution. Keep in mind, the issues I&rsquo;ve been discussing are ubiquitous across campuses all over the country; they aren&rsquo;t confined to one institution. The majority of these issues come up at most institutions. After I talk to everyone, I devise a list of suggestions and an improvement plan for the institution to enact so that they can create a more accepting campus climate. Some of these institutions implement these suggestions to create a more inclusive environment. Some of them, but not all of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our research and assessments show that students want to feel as if they belong at an institution. They want to know they are more than just a number. They want to feel as if they&rsquo;re at home, and that they&rsquo;re accepted. They don&#39;t want to go somewhere where they&#39;re just spending their money. At the same time, we don&#39;t want to give them participation trophies they don&rsquo;t earn. We have to give the students what they paid for and what they paid for was to grow and develop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got to stop looking at the numbers. We&rsquo;ve got to stop saying, &ldquo;Well if I offend a student, they&rsquo;ll leave and if they leave, our institution won&rsquo;t have any money.&rdquo; I get it, there is pressure coming from above. In order to keep the institution&rsquo;s doors open, you have to keep the students enrolled. I&rsquo;ve seen shifts in student affairs where students are now getting three, four, five or even ten alcohol violations, yet the students are still enrolled. Are we teaching our students that if you break the law, you&#39;re going to get ten chances? Are we teaching our students that they can do whatever they want and there are no consequences? That&rsquo;s a dangerous lesson, and we&#39;re the ones teaching it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; We often talk about our students of color transferring. Why? Our students of color are transferring because some feel as though our schools don&rsquo;t support their culture! Now <em>that </em>is an issue! Can you comprehend a student thinking they need to transfer because a school doesn&rsquo;t represent or support their background?&nbsp; What does that mean? It means that we might need to start going to different areas to recruit students. Students need to see other people that look like them on college campuses. This is not solely for students, but professionals as well. We might need to change how HR recruits professionals of color. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s hard to find footing at an institution when the surrounding areas are devoid of diversity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, as a Black male attending, Slippery Rock University, there were no places where a brotha could get a haircut. I had to rely on other Black students to cut my hair, or drive an hour to the nearest city. Often times, I had to contemplate and map out how long I could go without a haircut. In Western Pennsylvania, stores label hair care products for Black people as the &ldquo;Ethnic Hair Care Section.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the Philadelphia area, all haircare products are stocked together, minus the label. So not only do students of color sometimes feel as if no one on campus understands them this feeling is compounded by the lack of diversity outside the campus in the larger community. Can you get a better understanding as to why some students don&rsquo;t feel at<em> home</em>?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can we help them feel at home? Well, we have to provide an environment where people love and care about them. We have to provide an atmosphere that makes them feel comfortable and at home. And, we have to provide them with the tools and resources that students can use and in turn, learn from. Are we too sensitive? Are we not sensitive enough? How many of your colleagues actually call you out when you say things that are inappropriate? I hear male colleagues saying very inappropriate things to our female colleagues. Yet, nobody calls them out. Why? Are we afraid of workplace retaliation? Are you afraid to go to HR? God forbid we have to go to sexual harassment training. We talk about how our guiding principles are the foundation upon which student affairs was created and how they are the groundwork for what we do. Maybe we are blindly following them without looking at what&#39;s really going on in front of us? How are you transferring your theory to practice if we&rsquo;re unaware of what&rsquo;s presently going on and pertinent to our students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every institution has a different makeup and personality. I know not everything in this book will apply to everyone reading it. I also know that a lot of you are reading this and are saying, &ldquo;Wow! He&rsquo;s hitting it right on the head!&rdquo; Maybe you&rsquo;re saying, &ldquo;Man, Justin&rsquo;s really going hard on white people, didn&rsquo;t he already have a chapter on white privilege, geez!&rdquo; Regardless, if the shoe fits, wear it. This chapter is about self-examination. This goes for everyone. These are examples of crucial issues we need to talk about in student affairs; yet, no one is talking about them. When you&rsquo;re in your divisional meetings, are these the questions and issues in the forefront of the conversation? Is this what we&rsquo;re assessing? Is the data that we&rsquo;re gathering from our students truly accurate? Am I even growing in my job or is my desk just collecting dust? Supervisors and managers should be consistently challenging, evolving, and growing professionals. I know this to be true because I have a supervisor who does this for me. I am constantly amazed by her ability to pull out the best in me and others in the field. If this isn&rsquo;t happening for you, something needs to change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All that being said, there are some common questions that student affairs professionals ask me and I would like to talk about those things. One question that I get often is, how should student affairs professionals challenge racism and discrimination? I would say the first thing that I would do to challenge racism and discrimination is to actually become aware that it exists. Are you aware of the discrimination that happens on your campus? Or are you not aware of it because it doesn&rsquo;t happen to you? Student affairs professionals need to take a step back and get a clear view of the experiences of all of our students. I&rsquo;ve done trainings at schools where the student conduct department is being sued by students of color because they feel as though they are receiving unfair treatment, that the charges against them are harsher compared to white students who are engaging in the same behavior. Is this happening at your institution? Do they even know who to go to in order to report injustices? Just as there is a large gap between actual incidents of sexual assault and reported incidents, there are far more incidents of racism and discrimination on our campuses than we&#39;ll ever know. One reason incidents of racism are underreported is because students don&rsquo;t know who to talk to about it. Another reason is they feel as though nothing will be done about it even if they do report it. Probably the best solution is to invest a bystander intervention training. We&rsquo;re all bystanders. We&#39;re all responsible for our fellow human, and we&#39;re all responsible for the climate on our campuses. If you hear someone using language that isn&rsquo;t inclusive, call them out on it. If you hear someone telling a racist joke, call them out on it. We have to challenge people. We have to be willing to help people grow. As a bystander, as a witness, we are responsible for incidents that are happening on campuses, without necessarily being the person who is causing it. We all have to intervene. If someone says an inappropriate word, we have to challenge it. If someone is engaging in inappropriate actions, we need to talk to them about it. If somebody is creating a culture at the campus, that is not reflective of our mission, goals and values, we have to change it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student affairs professionals ask me, how do I create inclusive environments? My response is: are you really listening to what students are saying? You might send out a survey and get a few respondents, but are you actually incorporating their suggestions? Furthermore, students don&rsquo;t care about emails. If your main means of advertising is posters and e-mails, you&rsquo;re failing! Students get so inundated with emails and ads, they have become obsolete. Think about your common bulletin board. It looks like a Staples store threw up on it! Students are not reading those ads! And, guess what? Neither are you. We&#39;re spending a lot of money and killing a lot of trees for nothing; talk about zero sustainability. The average student is getting about 60 emails a day. They&#39;re not reading your e-mail about your program that&#39;s happening two weeks from now. If it&#39;s happening two weeks from now, students don&#39;t care until about three hours prior to it starting. For the most part, our students are only attending programs if we&#39;re giving out condoms and pizza anyway. We need to change how we&#39;re going about marketing our programming efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you&#39;re talking about inclusive environments, do your students feel as if they&#39;re part of the community? Is there someone they know they could go to if they have a problem, a professional? Right now, I&rsquo;m sure you can probably think of five students you know by name, but you might not know about their family or their hobbies. You might not know the things they&rsquo;re struggling with or what kind of week they&rsquo;ve just had. Those are the things that students want to share in an inclusive community. Yes, sometimes it&#39;s awkward. Sometimes our students don&#39;t understand why we&rsquo;re talking with them. They might think it&rsquo;s a little weird, especially if you&rsquo;ve never really had a conversation with them before. If, however, you make those efforts from the beginning, you initiating conversation with them will seem more authentic. You could approach a student and say, &ldquo;Hey, I noticed you come by my office a lot, but I never got your name.&rdquo; When they reply with their name, that&rsquo;s the start of a personal dialogue. Invite them back with a, &ldquo;Next time you stop by the office, I would love to chat.&rdquo; This action plants a seed. We talked about what happens with seeds of negativity and seeds of positivity. Those seeds of positivity are the reminders that someone really wants to talk to them. You would be very surprised at the number of students who would take you up on your offer. Do you go to lunch with students? Do you show up at students programs and not just sit in the back? If you&rsquo;re not there to interact and be a part of the program, don&rsquo;t go! You&rsquo;re sending more of a negative message by doing nothing than not going at all. You have to be integrated into their lives; you have to be active; you have to be there! That&rsquo;s how you create inclusive communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a diversity trainer, it&rsquo;s interesting to go through diversity training with some of my colleagues. I&rsquo;ve had colleagues say to me during training, &ldquo;Justin, I&rsquo;m just so sorry for my whiteness.&rdquo; As if I can be responsible for that! They say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see you as a color Justin, I just see you as you.&rdquo; Like I woke up this morning and figured out for the first time that I was Black. I have a lot of white colleagues who ask me, &ldquo;As a white student affairs professional, what can I do to support my Black colleagues or students?&rdquo; It&#39;s called just that; support. You might not understand it, just try to be empathetic and listen. You might not have ever gone through whatever it is they have, but be empathetic. If there is a racially charged issue in society and it is bleeding into your campus, think about what you say before you say it. Take a step back and think about someone other than yourself. That requires you to not be selfish. Again, support means much more than putting a sign on your door with a slogan. It may mean going to a student affairs colleague and saying, &ldquo;You know, when Trayvon Martin was shot and killed, I can&rsquo;t comprehend what you and the community may be feeling. I don&rsquo;t understand it, but if you feel comfortable and wanted to talk about it, I&#39;m here to support you. I&#39;m here to listen; I&#39;m not here to tell you what you should feel. I&rsquo;m not here to tell you what you should do. I just want you to know if you ever want to take time to help me understand, I would be open to that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student affairs professionals, know that it is not your Black colleague&rsquo;s job to come in and educate you. It&rsquo;s not our job to inform you about all things &ldquo;Black.&rdquo; It&#39;s not our job to consistently give you professional development every single time something happens. Black professionals are T-I-R-E-D; we are exhausted! We can&#39;t be responsible for our own growth and development and your growth and development too. It&rsquo;s going to take some effort on your part. As student affairs professionals, if you mess up, own it; don&#39;t make excuses for why you said something or did something. Sometimes professionals do things that are offensive. Guess what? It happens! As Black student affairs professionals, we sometimes do things that are offensive too. Black professionals have to own up to it too! When you make a mistake, own up to it! Say, &ldquo;You know what, I&rsquo;m sorry. I stink right now and I&rsquo;m going to try to do better in the future.&rdquo; Own it! Make amends! Move forward! Grow from the experience! If you&rsquo;re not growing as a student affairs professional, you are wasting your time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People ask me all the time, what do I feel is the biggest problem in student affairs? That&rsquo;s a very loaded question. I think there are a lot of issues in student affairs just like in any other field. I do believe, however, that one of the biggest issues is many of our offices are siloed. Some institutions have multiple departments such as the women&rsquo;s center, multicultural office, LGBTQIA, and so on but only collaborate on one program, once a semester. We have to stop this! For example, if there&rsquo;s an issue in regards to female students, don&rsquo;t just immediately send them to the women&rsquo;s center. No! It&#39;s everybody&#39;s responsibility to make sure we are educated about issues that affect our female students. Too often we refer students and bounce them around from office to office. Yes, some issues need to be dealt with by the women&rsquo;s center, but handle what you can. Just don&rsquo;t push students out of your office because you don&rsquo;t want to deal with the issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example, there&rsquo;s an issue relating to our students of color, so let&#39;s send them to the multicultural office. No! You should be equipped and skilled enough to handle a student issue regardless of race, gender, background, sexual orientation, religion, culture, or ethnicity. When an issue arises that we may not be comfortable with, we&rsquo;re so quick to transfer students. Students don&rsquo;t like that and parents don&#39;t like it either. I know of an institution that doesn&#39;t allow you to transfer calls; you&rsquo;re just not allowed to do it. When a parent or student calls, you have to ask them to hold on while you get the answer for them, instead of saying, I&rsquo;m going to transfer you to that office. Nobody likes to be transferred! You want the answer from the person who picked up the phone. Are we doing that? Are we taking the time to really get to know what other offices are doing? Or, do we only know what the other offices are doing when we get a newsletter or mass email listing what the office is working on. Not that it matters since most of us are deleting those emails without even reading them. We don&#39;t even support other offices&rsquo; initiatives. We only show up to their programs when there&rsquo;s food. Or, we only show up to their programs when someone comes to our office and give us a personalized invitation; as if we&#39;re so high and mighty in our department and require a personal initiation or we won&rsquo;t go! We can&rsquo;t have iron-clad boundaries that prevent us from collaborating with one another. We need to have permeable boundaries that allow us to be involved with other departments on campus working together for the good of the students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t assume professionals from other offices only have one skillset in their tool bag. Just because they work in residence life, doesn&rsquo;t mean they only have knowledge and skills related to housing. Just because they work in student activities, doesn&#39;t mean they only know how to put on programs. Just because they&#39;re in student recreation, doesn&rsquo;t mean they only know about how to stay active. Many of our colleagues are talented and skilled in many different facets of student affairs. We need to remove the stereotype that people only know one thing and that they&#39;re only well-versed in one area of expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say another big issue in student affairs is that both academic affairs and student affairs do not work with each other. We must efficiently work together in order for institutions to be successful. Individuals in student affairs have a negative attitude about academic affairs. They think academic affairs personnel are a little stuck up and that they don&rsquo;t want to work with us either. I get it! Somebody has got to lay down the weapons down say, &ldquo;Look, in order for our institution to work to its capacity, we need to work collaboratively.&rdquo; In fact models show that academic affairs and student affairs divisions that work well together increase enrollment rates, retention rates, and graduation rates. Isn&rsquo;t that our goal as an institution? This requires, however, both offices to meet in the middle. Academic affairs professionals have their stereotypes about us as well. Some of them believe student affairs professionals are glorified babysitters. Some believe that we play games with the students or should not be taken seriously because we are not part of the academy. I&rsquo;ve even been told that people in the academy don&rsquo;t recognize our field because they see our theories as hijacked. They say we take theories from other fields and apply them as our own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to make the effort to bridge the gap. Right now, you&rsquo;re probably thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made an effort. I&rsquo;ve tried to get them to collaborate together.&rdquo; TRY AGAIN! If you work in academic affairs and you&rsquo;re reading this, you have to work together with student affairs. We are not professional babysitters! We are not carnival workers! We&rsquo;re not just creating flashy programs so that our students are happy! Sure we do that, it&rsquo;s part of providing an engaging and fun experience for our students, but that is a small portion of our job. We need to change how we perceive our student affairs professionals. What do you think student affairs professionals are doing? When you ask people about their profession, they tell you what they do. For example, if you asked a baker what they do, they would say, &ldquo;I bake; I&rsquo;m a baker.&rdquo; When you ask someone in academic affairs what they do, they say, &ldquo;I teach; I&rsquo;m a teacher.&rdquo; What do you think student affairs people say? Well, we say, &ldquo;We teach as well.&rdquo; We may not be teaching a standardized curriculum with a syl', '2020-05-29 13:33:16', '2020-05-29 13:33:16', NULL);

(12, 20, '11', '<p>HOORAY! You are the real MVP, you made it until the last chapter of the book, nice job! I know that some of you probably jumped right to this chapter because you heard me say, &ldquo;If you&#39;re looking for encouragement during your day, run to this chapter.&rdquo; I am literally putting my heart on the page here people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who are looking for a summary of the book in this final chapter, I&rsquo;m sorry, but you will not find it here. To conclude this conversation about diversity, it would imply that diversity could be concluded or have a finale. This simply isn&rsquo;t the case. Diversity is fluid &ndash; it is constantly changing and evolving. We as individuals need to be able to fully adapt and change with it. Instead, I chose to use this final chapter to incorporate life lessons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Life lessons are essential, and trust me, I have a lot of them. Many of you will read this book through a very critical eye. Several of you, who have much higher degrees than I have, at the moment at least, may be asking, &ldquo;Where is the theory, where is the research, where is the data that supports all these things that Justin said throughout the book?&rdquo; This book wasn&rsquo;t about that. This book is about all of my experiences, my thoughts, my heart, the conversations that I have had with students, faculty, and staff, as well as the things that I&#39;ve seen. This book is about putting all that on paper to share with you. People have encouraged me to go out and speak, to go out and write, and to push my message through other means and that&#39;s what this book is &ndash; a culmination of those delivery channels, all rolled into text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This book wasn&rsquo;t written to shape the very foundation of student affairs. It isn&rsquo;t to tell you about some groundbreaking new theory or some new assessment tool that was going to change the whole facet of our field. This book is for everyone &ndash; student affairs professionals, educators, students, that person who heard about my experiences, and anyone who wanted to learn something new. I want you to be encouraged. I want you to know that there is someone else out there that understands you and values your feelings and ideas. That&rsquo;s where this book came from. This last chapter is just really going to be spoken from my heart. As I&rsquo;m writing this, I&rsquo;m thinking about the encouraging words that were given to me and those that I have given to others. Honestly, this last chapter is almost like a sendoff. If you made it this far in the book, great! If you just picked up the book so you could read this last chapter, awesome! Because, I personally feel is this chapter is the most important. Either way, I hope you learn something. I hope that this book inspired you. I hope that this book challenged you. I hope that this book made you laugh. I hope that this book made you question things. I hope that this book made you angry. I hope that you experienced a lot of different emotions because I was being real and honest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My parents are the most amazing parents ever! They are just so supportive and they show me unconditional love. They smack when I need to be smacked, and they hug me when I needed to be hugged. They&rsquo;ve been very influential to me regarding the way I see things, the way that I understand individuals, and in the way that I accept people into my heart and my mind. I think that my grandmother has also been a very influential person in my life when it comes to pursuing education. One thing that my parents always told me to do, and some people will think this is weird but I still do it today, was to keep a pen and paper right next to my bed when I go to sleep. I don&#39;t know why, but I get my best ideas when I&#39;m asleep. My mind just continues to run and I don&rsquo;t want to forget anything. Keeping the pen and paper next to my bed allows me to wake up in the middle of the night and jot down all those great things. I literally wake up some mornings and there&rsquo;s already a great idea written down on the paper. I don&rsquo;t know how it got there; not sure where it came from and I certainly don&rsquo;t know what the heck I was thinking about that night, but I wake up with a phenomenal idea! I was that person, who woke in the morning, turned on the TV and saw those infomercials for some crazy, new invention and said, &ldquo;Oh my gosh! I totally should have thought about that!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oh my goodness! I could&rsquo;ve come up with that! Now that person is making a million dollars!&rdquo; How many of you have ever thought like that? That is definitely me. I want to tell you, if you have an idea, a great invention, or you can feel that something is missing in the marketplace, it&#39;s up to you to do it. I know a lot of you probably have things that you&rsquo;re always saying you want to do. What I want you to do is come up with three things that you want to do in the next thirty days and then do it! Who&rsquo;s stopping you from doing these things? There are so many things we can accomplish, if we just make short term goals. Thirty days people! That&rsquo;s accomplishing a dream every ten days! What do you want to do? What do you want to create? What&#39;s stopping you from pursuing your dreams? This was one of the things that my parents instilled in me that I will be forever grateful for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was even making inventions when I was a kid. I remember the summer of 1999. I was 10 years old, and it was a really hot summer in Philadelphia. This was the summer that three Philadelphia Eagles players collapsed during practice due to heat exhaustion. As a 10 year old kid, I remember that I decided I was going to make this special helmet. This helmet had a special dot on the back that would allow the coach and player personnel to know when a player needed to be taken out due to overheating. Guess what? My parents didn&rsquo;t shut down the idea. They said, &ldquo;Justin, this is a really great idea; you need to do something with this!&rdquo; At 10 years old, my parents took me to a patent lawyer and I got my idea notarized and copyrighted. I couldn&#39;t get my foot into the NFL because it&rsquo;s such a huge company, but that didn&rsquo;t matter. It was the fact that my parents supported me. Whether the idea was dumb, that didn&rsquo;t matter. Whether I could do it or not, that wasn&rsquo;t the point either. The point is, my parents supported me. They taught me that you can&#39;t just sit on ideas &ndash; you need to move them forward, you need to act on them. I know that you all have ideas as well. I would like to tell you that if you haven&#39;t done it yet, you haven&#39;t thought about it yet, take the time to think, take the time write, and take your ideas out and make them a reality. Why are you sitting on them? These things can&rsquo;t help you if you&#39;re not working on them. Before you read any more of this chapter, I want you to know, this whole book will not help you at all until you&#39;re ready to work on yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout this book, we talked about stereotypes, prejudices, perception, women&#39;s issues, multicultural awareness, and diversity. We talked about <em>This or That</em> and all those other activities and concepts. You probably learned a lot of things that will help you, but until you work on yourself these concepts can&rsquo;t help you. That&rsquo;s what this chapter is really about &ndash; taking the time to work and build on ourselves. None of us are perfect; we&rsquo;re all works in progress. We all have issues and things we need to work on. It&rsquo;s about finding out who you are. If you have found yourself, that&#39;s great! If you haven&rsquo;t, I hope that this chapter really encourages you to do so. I like to say, &ldquo;If you can dream it, you can do it!&rdquo; A lot of you are sitting on ideas that could change how our world operates. We need to continue to encourage our students to go into the math and sciences. We&rsquo;re only one person or one degree away from the cure to cancer. Why aren&rsquo;t we encouraging more kids to get into the math and sciences? Why aren&rsquo;t we encouraging their creativity and innovation? We represent America, one of the greatest nations on earth, yet we&#39;ve fallen behind in education and can&rsquo;t keep up. We need to be plucking from everybody; children, teenagers, the elderly, men, women, rich, or poor; everybody has something. If you&rsquo;re dreaming it, you can certainly do it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to let you know that I&#39;m not perfect. I&#39;m not a perfect man &ndash; I&#39;m far from it. I have a lot of things that I need to work on. And, I&rsquo;m not always right. Never in this book did I say that my way is the right way and your way is wrong. There are probably a lot of things in this book that you disagree with and that&#39;s great! Why? Because I&rsquo;m still a young guy; I haven&rsquo;t been around that long; I&#39;ve been challenged; I&#39;ve been stretched; I&#39;ve been developed; I&#39;ve been told that I was wrong; I&#39;ve been told to look at things in a different way; I&rsquo;ve given opinions and I&rsquo;ve taken heed to others opinions. You have to do that as well. If you&#39;re not being challenged on a daily basis, you&rsquo;re wasting your time. If you&#39;re not being stretched to capacity, you&#39;re wasting your time. If you haven&#39;t allowed yourself to develop, you&#39;re wasting time. We have got to continue to have these concepts and hold them close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I said before, I think that life has three best teachers. These don&rsquo;t represent someone who has been in a classroom and they&rsquo;re not a parent, friend, or even a mentor. I think the three greatest teachers in life are heartbreaks, empty pockets, and failures. Unfortunately, I have been the recipient of all three of those things! Let&rsquo;s look at heartbreak &ndash; I&rsquo;ve had heartbreak, as I&rsquo;m sure you have as well. Heartbreak is painful, it challenges your morals and values, it can even make you wonder why you continue. There are people in this world who just don&#39;t know how to function alongside another. Like my dad always says, &ldquo;Hurt people, hurt people.&rdquo; And, people can only meet you where they&rsquo;ve already met themselves. Heartbreak is terrible. It makes you want to give up and throw in the towel. It makes you feel abandoned or that you&rsquo;re disposable. It&rsquo;s a giant, life-altering experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s think about empty pockets &ndash; they are rough! I know people who don&#39;t have two pennies to rub together and don&#39;t know where their next meal is coming from. They don&#39;t know where they&#39;re going to be able to find accessible water to wash up or clean their clothes. They don&rsquo;t know where they will find shelter so that they don&rsquo;t freeze in the winter. Empty pockets can really teach you some harsh lessons. I hear kids complaining during the holiday season about not getting the latest iPad. Yet, and yes I&rsquo;m bringing it up again and will continue to until something is done about it, the citizens of Flint, MI still don&rsquo;t have clean water! Where are our priorities as a country? It&rsquo;s just crazy and it&rsquo;s unacceptable!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Failure is our last teacher. I have failed at a lot of things and it hurts! You feel defeated, you feel discouraged, and ultimately you question why you tried in the first place. Failure is the best teacher. You&rsquo;re not going to do well at anything, if you always know you&rsquo;ll succeed. What would you do if you knew you couldn&rsquo;t fail? What would you try? What would you attempt? Or would you just skate on by? There they are, life&rsquo;s three biggest teachers! Have some or all of these things taught you? What have you gained from the teachings?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I always think this line is pretty funny and I say it to a lot of my students, but it has pertinence to today. This line is &ldquo;Always be yourself, unless you can be Batman; and if you can be Batman, you should definitely be Batman!&rdquo; My students laugh and it&rsquo;s funny, but now that I&rsquo;m thinking more about it, Batman has a lot of significance. You&rsquo;ll see a little bit of my nerdy side coming out with this one! Batman is a representation of what happens when justice isn&rsquo;t served. Batman&rsquo;s parents were killed when he was a kid. The person who murdered his parents got away. Bruce Wayne had to figure out what he was going to do. The justice system didn&rsquo;t serve him, so he was left with vengeance. He wanted justice and he got it on his own. It&#39;s the same thing that&#39;s happening in this country to our individuals of color. When justice isn&rsquo;t served, people have to find a means of carrying it out in their own way. It doesn&#39;t mean that they should riot, but even riots can be subjective. When there&rsquo;s an injustice affecting the Black community, some people look at Black people who are destroying property and they see it as rioting. But when a hockey, football, baseball, or basketball team wins the championship game and people go out and destroy stuff, why is that not called a riot? We need to pay attention to what&rsquo;s really going on to <em>everyone</em> in this country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the same sense, immigration is viewed this way. I think it&#39;s so funny, not funny ha-ha, but an ironic funny, that we close our boarders for refugees and immigrants. Yet, that is exactly how this country was started. What we&rsquo;re really saying is that it&rsquo;s okay for people from this country to come here, but it&rsquo;s not okay for people to come here from that country. It seems pretty clear how we make the distinction of who is an acceptable immigrant and who is not. This is based off the color of their skin or the god they pray to. How are we deciding these factors? Why is not based on the morality of helping someone in need? Why is it not about bringing new ideas and perspectives into our rich and vibrant communities? I just can&rsquo;t help but think that the cure for cancer can be in the mind of one of these refugees. But no one was willing to help them survive. Their life was not valued because they were the wrong type of immigrant or refugee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to keep in mind that there are dreamers and there are doers. You don&rsquo;t want to be a dreamer. You&rsquo;re probably thinking that my last statement completely contradicts everything I&rsquo;ve shared with you in this book. No, it doesn&#39;t &ndash; there are differences between dreamers and doers. Dreaming is free, but the hustle is sold separately. What I mean by that is you must be a person of action. There&rsquo;s that one thing on your bucket list that you&rsquo;ve always wanted to do. You shouldn&rsquo;t even have a bucket list; there should be nothing in your bucket! Why? Because you should be completing these things every day! You should be moving forward to complete your goals. Who wants to wait until they&rsquo;re 50 to start their goals? Who wants until their on their deathbed before doing something they&rsquo;ve always wanted to do? If you&lsquo;ve always want to do it, do it today! People say, &ldquo;Why put off today what you can do tomorrow?&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;NO! Why put off tomorrow, what you can do today?&rdquo; Why not get these things done. Being a dreamer is cool &ndash; having dreams is great. But being able to have those dreams and make them come true by action is even better!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They put erasers on pencils because everyone makes mistakes, and if you think you&rsquo;re a pen you&rsquo;re in for world of trouble! We&rsquo;ve got people breaking up relationships. We have people being kicked out of church. We constantly see war, crime, and sex on TV. There are a lot of things in this world that can take your joy and happiness away. Wherever you can find little pieces of happiness, take it. Some people find happiness at a Starbucks, some people find it in funny cat videos on YouTube, and some people find their joy by seeing friends and family. There are some people who get their joy from their kids, some people get their joy by going on vacation, and some from reading a good book. Find those things that make you feel happy! Personal wellness is so important people! When you find something that makes you happy and brings you joy, hold on to it. Find other people who enjoy those things and form relationships around that joy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that people&#39;s beliefs are based upon the realities that they see. If your reality is that everything in America is fine, you&rsquo;re probably going to be greatly disturbed when someone comes in and says America is racist, unjust, sexist, or homophobic. You&#39;re not going to see or feel those things if they don&#39;t directly impact you. Since your beliefs are based on only the things you see, what I would encourage people to do is wipe the scales away from their eyes. Break down the sanctuary of their own thinking in order to see things for what they really are. I&rsquo;m not even saying that you can&rsquo;t think your opinion is right. What I&rsquo;m saying is, before you make an opinion about something, see both sides. Before you&#39;re committed to your opinion, also recognize that other opinions exist and be able to look at things from a different perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Growth is powerful people! Growth creates change, it creates development, and ultimately growth creates personality differences. Growth can be painful and uncomfortable. But, we all certainly love the benefits of growth. Think about when you were a child and you couldn&rsquo;t reach things that were on the top shelf, you couldn&rsquo;t drive a car, you couldn&#39;t buy a house, and you couldn&rsquo;t get into the bar. We couldn&rsquo;t wait and we were so happy to finally grow up. So happy, that once we grew up, the first thing we wanted to do was become kids again. Why? Because growth is seen as something that is so positive and great. But, I think that the process of growth is actually more rewarding, satisfying, and nurturing than actual growth itself. Once you actually grow, you&rsquo;re there! That&rsquo;s present tense &ndash; you already grew and can&rsquo;t go back. The growing process is the part where you learn the lessons. It&rsquo;s the part where you find out more about yourself. It&#39;s the part where you are actually making your own set of values. Not the values that your family gave you, or the ones you learned in school, and not the ones based on your friends. You get to set your own values that can create change in your life and make you who you are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about the things you needed in a person while you were growing up. Someone to mentor you, support and encourage you, someone to tell you everything&#39;s going to be alright, who had your back no matter what, and someone who showed up to all of your concerts or sporting events. That person who sent you small notes or a card to cheer you up, the person who would just check up on you for no particular reason, or the person who sent you a text message just to make sure you were operating. Don&rsquo;t forget the person who cooked you a good meal just so you had some food in your belly and the person that said good morning to you because they really hoped that you had a good morning. Be the person that you needed growing up! Be the person you need now. I hate when people say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need anybody. I&rsquo;m good on my own.&rdquo; No one can do it all by themselves! We all need people. People say these things because they are hurt or bitter because of something that happened to them. They feel like humanity has failed them. They think that no one can truly be there for them because no has been there for them before. I mean to tell you that everybody needs somebody! We can&rsquo;t do it alone. Be that person you needed when you were growing up or in need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are times in my life that I had to be more with less. I&#39;ve had pains. I&#39;ve had people hurt me. I&#39;ve had a door shut right in my face. I&rsquo;ve had people laugh at me. I&rsquo;ve had people talk about me behind my back. I&rsquo;ve had friends completely turn on me. I&#39;ve had people go out of their way to take me down. I&#39;ve had people throw my name in the dirt. I&rsquo;ve made plans for my life that fell through. When you can&#39;t do anything else and you&#39;ve done all you can, that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;ll know just how strong you truly are. Sometimes people just have to do more with less. There are a lot of people out there dealing with depression. I&rsquo;m telling you, don&rsquo;t give up. If you know someone who has depression, get them help or be the help that they need; don&#39;t give up. We all know people out there who are hurting, who are in pain, who are thinking about taking their lives &ndash; you need to be the person those people need. Don&#39;t give up. If you&#39;re one of those people who are thinking about a job change because you don&#39;t think that you&#39;re making an impact, don&rsquo;t give up. If you feel that every single thing that you&#39;re doing is not effective and not creating change, don&#39;t give up. Sometimes you&rsquo;ve got to be more with less. Sometimes you&#39;ve got to fail to succeed. I&rsquo;ve shared that failure has been my best teacher because you don&#39;t know what you can overcome without failing. I just think that there are more important things to fight for and there are more important things to consider. And failure teaches you those things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are more important things that we need to be talking about here in America. Are we swiping the card or inserting the chip? Nobody has come up with a debate or come up with a complete conclusion on this topic. We need to define those things because it&rsquo;s frustrating! That&rsquo;s when failure comes up and it&rsquo;s frustrating. We&rsquo;re not finding a complete and concrete conclusion on things. It&rsquo;s really hard when you fail because it feels like you haven&#39;t completed what you set out to do. Failure is really a life changing component to how we all live and grow. You can&#39;t tell me that the sky&#39;s the limit when I&#39;ve seen footprints on the moon. I know in student affairs, we talk a lot about the glass ceiling. I&rsquo;m here to tell you, we need to break that glass ceiling, let&rsquo;s take a hammer to it! You&#39;re only going to be as great as you allow yourself to be. I know that there are systematic frameworks that keep us from reaching a certain thing. I know that there&rsquo;s a wage gap and inequality in a lot of things. I know that the system is designed so that some people always succeed. Despite those things that hold us back, we need to continue to move forward, we need to push through. We need to challenge the status quo. We need to break down walls. I&rsquo;m tired of using those things as crutches &ndash; we can&rsquo;t and we shouldn&rsquo;t. The sky is not the limit for me. If you can shoot for the moon, and even if you miss, you&rsquo;re still shining with the stars. We need to continue to do those things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In life not everybody is going to like you. Let me repeat that, not everybody&rsquo;s going to like you. Suck it up, deal with it! Stop thinking that life was made so everybody can be like you, so you can be popular, so everybody is going to be on board with what you do. As a Christian, I remind myself that not everyone even liked Jesus. So how do you expect everyone to like you? Stop being a fake! Stop trying to be something that you&#39;re not so that people can like you! Stop trying to suck up to people so that they accept you! It&rsquo;s just not going to be like that. You can probably list five people right now who hate your guts, and they probably don&#39;t even have a reason to hate you. That&rsquo;s what haters do! They find some reason, something about you, and then they hate! But I love my haters because that means there&#39;s something so special about me and such a light that is in me, that I didn&#39;t even know that I had. And that made the hater go out of their way to hate me! That shows me that people are paying attention and it shows me that I&rsquo;m making a difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t give up on people. You can&rsquo;t. There are people out there that need you. You can probably think of a few people right now who are dependent upon you. It&#39;s very easy to give up on people. Giving up is the easy thing to do. The hard thing is to work with people. I&rsquo;m sure a lot of you are in relationships, some of your married. Don&#39;t give up on people! Some days as a partner, you can&rsquo;t be 100%, sometimes you can only give 60%. You&rsquo;ll need your partner to pick up the slack. That&rsquo;s why we can&#39;t give up on people. If you get married, you may take a vow that says for better or for worse. For better or for worse, they&rsquo;re not just words; it has to mean something. If you&rsquo;re getting married just to get married; don&#39;t do it! Do it because you really want to be with that person for the rest of your life, do it because that person makes you complete. Do it because you can&#39;t live without that person and want to make a commitment to that person. But above all, please make sure that it&#39;s a true commitment and not something that you feel in the moment. Feelings change and that&rsquo;s why you need to base it on what you know, not just what you feel. If I punched you in the arm right now, it would probably hurt, but eventually the hurt would go away. That hurt and pain you felt is just a feeling, and it didn&rsquo;t last forever. If you know, in your head, that a punch is always going to hurt, that&rsquo;s not going to change. But feelings can change. If you&rsquo;re truly taking vows and promising to be someone, then you have to be willing to be that same person if the feelings change some over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that people will be happy once they find the courage to let go of what they can&#39;t control. As a complete, 100% control freak, I&#39;m here to tell you that. I don&#39;t like when the power is taken away from me. I was once told that if you ever want to make God laugh, tell him your plans. Sometimes I feel like I&rsquo;m a one-man comedy show for God. He&rsquo;s sitting up there laughing at me and probably has some things repeat! If this show was on DVD, God would buy the Blu-ray special edition with the deleted scenes. I tell God all the time, these are my plans. I come up with plans and ideas. I write them all down with a timeline of the specific times and places that they&rsquo;ll happen. But life doesn&#39;t work like that and neither do people. You&#39;re literally a couple seconds away from your life changing. Someone could die, you could go bankrupt, you could get sued, or you could be in a car accident. Anything could happen at any time, just in the blink an eye. You can&#39;t control every single thing in your life. You can have a plan but your plans aren&rsquo;t always going to happen the way you want them to. Do you get mad at God because he didn&#39;t give you what you wanted when you wanted it? Are you mad at God because he shut the door in your face or because your plans didn&rsquo;t go the way you wanted them to? Are you just going to give up and throw in the towel because it didn&#39;t go your way? You can&rsquo;t do that! You have got to continue to move forward despite the events that take place. And, when you finally decide to let go, you truly have to do it. Believe me, letting go takes courage, you can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;let go.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not as easy as that. Is anyone else singing <em>Frozen </em>&ldquo;Let It Go&rdquo; right now, or is it just me? Everyone was so obsessed with that song! But anyway, it takes courage to let go, it takes pride to let go, and it takes humility to let go. Some things that we don&#39;t want to let go aren&rsquo;t good for us but we need to in order to move forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some days you have to make your own sunshine. I know there&#39;s a lot of people who come to me, and probably come to you as well, for encouragement. But, sometimes people need to encourage themselves. Sometimes you have to be your own cheerleader. I&#39;m telling you that I&#39;ve gone through things in my life where I literally had to wake up in the morning, look myself in the mirror and say, &ldquo;Today is going to be a good day!&rdquo; Good days are not dependent on other people, they are determined by you. If you had $3,000 and somebody stole $5.00 of it, are you just going to go ahead and completely shred the other $2,995? No! You&rsquo;re going to keep that money. So, if you have 1,440 minutes in a day, are you going to allow somebody who messed up five minutes destroy the remaining 1,435 minutes? It&#39;s the same concept. We can&rsquo;t allow people to do that. We have got to be able to make our own sunshine, encourage ourselves, and have our own self-esteem. That&#39;s why it&#39;s called &ldquo;self&rdquo; esteem. While it&rsquo;s great to rely on people to help boost us up, what are you doing to boost yourself? What are the things you&rsquo;re doing to encourage yourself? How are you making the best out of your day? Creating your own sunshine is extremely important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to know why people are waiting for permission to be great. Every single one of us is made from a different cloth &ndash; different backgrounds, experiences, situations, lessons that were taught to us, and ways of living. Why are you waiting for permission to be great? You want to be great, but maybe you haven&rsquo;t gotten there yet. What are you waiting for? Get off your butt, go do something you haven&#39;t tried before, go learn something, go eat food you&rsquo;ve never tried, or travel to a different country. Why are you waiting for permission? Go out there and make something of yourself. I want to hear about you. Right now, you probably never met me but if you did, you would be thinking, I knew Justin was going to write a book one day, but you weren&rsquo;t waiting for me to do it. I wanted to do it, I went out there and I completed it. The time for &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; are over. Get it done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that in life only a few people care, the rest are just curious. You&#39;ve got to be able to operate with who&rsquo;s supposed to be in your life for a season, and with who&rsquo;s supposed to be in your life forever. You can&#39;t be upset because in your story of life, some people choose to walk out. Just like on TV, some characters get written off, it just happens. Obviously you&#39;re going to be sad about it but it just means that their part of the story is over. You have to carry on to the next episode. They&rsquo;re going to be some people coming into you&rsquo;re your life and maybe it&rsquo;s only for one season &ndash; a guest appearance. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s like that. Sometimes their character is only on the show for a few episodes and then they leave for whatever reason. You can&#39;t make other people&#39;s problems your problem. I&rsquo;m sure a lot of you are thinking, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t that person stay...they were supposed to be my friend? Or, if you&rsquo;re thinking about a relationship, &ldquo;Why did that person leave me? What did I do wrong?&rdquo; Again, you can&#39;t make other people&#39;s issues your issues. People do things all the time for whatever reason they want, sometimes just because they want to. It has nothing to do with you. You could have treated them like a queen or a king and they still left, so why are you sitting here worrying about people who want nothing to do with you. There are plenty of other people who care about you and want what is the best for you. Those are the people you need to pay attention to. Those people are your support system and that&#39;s where your central focus needs to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think people need to focus on who they are &ndash; their business and their actions. I don&#39;t want to talk, I want to act. I don&#39;t want to say, I want to show. I don&#39;t want to promise, I want to prove. Listen, people with integrity are very predictable. As Justin LaKyle Brown, I know that I&#39;m a man of routine too. If you know me, you probably know my routine. You know what time I&rsquo;m getting up, when I&rsquo;m eating lunch, whether it&rsquo;s TV time or work out time, and you what time I&rsquo;m going to bed. I&rsquo;m tired of just being a person who says stuff. I want to be somebody who people recognize, if I said I&rsquo;ll do something then I can and will. I want to be somebody that will take care of something if I said I&rsquo;ll take care of it &ndash; a man of my word. Don&#39;t you want to have a reputation of being a person that&#39;s about business and action, not just talk? Those are the legacies you leave behind. Those are the things that you teach your kids and your grandkids. Those are the examples to show other people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you know that sometimes the only Bible that some people will read is your life? I don&#39;t have to go out and say, &ldquo;I&#39;m a Christian! I&#39;m a Christian! Be a Christian!&rdquo; No, I don&rsquo;t have to do that. People know I&#39;m a Christian based on how I speak, how I treat others, and how I live my life. Don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s more of a turning point for people than trying to force people to change just because I want them to? That&rsquo;s a better witness than forcing the Bible down someone&rsquo;s throat. Sometimes it&rsquo;s not even about religion because they&#39;re just good people that are out there. Good people do exist; not everybody in this world is out to get you or hurt you. One of the best things that my friend Terrece told me was, &ldquo;Always keep your guard up.&rdquo; In any situation, anything can go awry, anything can go sideways. It&rsquo;s great that you want to help people. You could probably think to yourself right now, who&#39;s the nicest person in your life? They probably get taken advantage of because everyone likes them and they can&rsquo;t say no to anyone &ndash; or is this person you? They&rsquo;re the person that probably gets hurt the most. How many of you wear your heart on your sleeve? It happens. It makes us very susceptible to get hurt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My friend Terrece told me to always keep my guard up, why? Because, as my friend, he wanted to protect me, himself, and others around him. Just because you have your guard up, doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t put your guard down. What he did tell me was, you don&rsquo;t put up a wall. If you put up a wall, it can help you, or it could hurt you. Walls were made to keep things out. A wall doesn&rsquo;t let anything in or out, kind of like a double edged sword. Are you letting people in? Are you truly opening up to new relationships and trying new things? Or, do you have a wall put up and you&rsquo;re living the same bitter life you do every day? If you&rsquo;re stuck on something that you&#39;ve been stuck on for five years, you&#39;ve got to let it go. If there are people you had issues with, go reconcile and put the pieces of the puzzle back together. Stop waiting for somebody to call you and apologize. Sometimes you have to take the loss and move on. Sometimes we have to accept the apologies that were never given to us. And, sometimes we got to be able to move forward without other people&#39;s blessing or forgiveness. Sometimes you have to make peace and apologize, even if it&rsquo;s small, and even if you don&rsquo;t think you were completely in the wrong. Imagine if everybody took responsibility for things, even some things they didn&rsquo;t do, how much better of a world this would be? If everybody said, &ldquo;I know that this was primarily your fault, but regardless, I still hold some responsibility in this too because maybe I could&rsquo;ve handled it differently.&rdquo; Imagine what the world would be like if everybody takes responsibility for the parts they play. Wouldn&rsquo;t we work together so much more smoothly? In any situation, everybody should take part of the blame. No one person is ever 100% responsible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, people suck. I&rsquo;d be lying if I told you that my entire life was full of individuals who supported me and wanted the best for me. While I have my strong supporters, I also was faced with many, many people who wanted to see me fail and enjoyed putting me down. These people were in all parts of my life &ndash; colleagues, friends, church folk, past relationships &ndash;people who just did not want me to be successful. My advice for you on this is that you have to push forward regardless. Identify the fakes and watch out for the traps. Not everyone with a friendly on their face is actually a friend. Life isn&rsquo;t about the amount of friends you have, it&rsquo;s about the influence and memories your true friends had on you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know that a lot of you don&rsquo;t believe in God or Jesus and that&rsquo;s fine. I&#39;m not here to tell you that you should. I think a lot of Christians try to force their beliefs and people don&#39;t want to hear that, and I understand. We can&rsquo;t get people to understand Christ when we&#39;re also saying and doing the same thing everyone else is doing. So, I&#39;m not going to tell you to believe in Christ. Do I wish that you could? Yeah, but I don&rsquo;t wish you could because that&rsquo;s what I believe. I&#39;m not pushing my beliefs on you. What I do want you to think is, you don&#39;t have to believe in God, but believe in something. Whether you believe in Allah, or practice Buddhism, Judaism, Scientology, or even if you believe in Goku, it doesn&#39;t matter. I just need you to believe in something. If you don&#39;t believe in any of those beings, at least believe in yourself. There are people that go around having no beliefs. Where do you base your understanding of life? How do you make connections work? Where do you get your values from? You&#39;ve got to believe in something. Does somebody believe in you? We have to believe in people too. Like I said previously, a lot of the time we give up on people. Do you really, in your heart, believe that people can change? Or are people always going to be the way they are? Everyone deserves a fair chance. I can only imagine where I would be if someone hadn&rsquo;t given me a chance or someone hadn&rsquo;t given me a shot. We have to be able to give people their shot too. Once they take it, it&#39;s on them. But, we should know that people want to do better for themselves. Some people want to be better, and for the people who don&rsquo;t, let them do what they do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can&rsquo;t be a leader if you&rsquo;re not ready to take L or the loses. If you don&#39;t want to take L, don&#39;t be a leader because there are a lot of times that I had to take that on, even though it wasn&rsquo;t on me. But it was my responsibility as the leader. There were times as the leader I had to say &ldquo;sorry&rdquo; even though I didn&#39;t do anything wrong. The times that I had to take responsibilities for things that didn&#39;t take place or didn&#39;t happen even though they weren&rsquo;t necessarily my fault. Leadership requires you to do more. And, leading is not always from the front. I know a lot of great leaders that lead from the back. We&#39;ve got to be able to shut that mentality of thinking down. Leaders come in a variety of shapes, colors, sizes, ethnicities, and different belief systems. Not every leader is an extrovert. Not every person who does great presentations is an extrovert. Not all introverts hate hanging out with people. We have to get out of the mindset that all leaders are a certain way. Anybody can be a leader, but it takes somebody with strength, humility, pride, and excellence in order to do so. Let life surprise you &ndash; sometimes you just have to go for it. Do you know how many things in life that didn&#39;t go the way I wanted them to that actually ended up working out better? We have to be able to let life be flexible. Things can&rsquo;t just go according to your plan. If you&#39;re not flexible, you&#39;re going to bend and you&#39;re going to break. We all know what it&#39;s like to break &ndash; to want to give up, to not be motivated, and to just want throw in the towel. Is that you right now? Let life surprise you. Go outside and bask in the sun, go meet somebody you&rsquo;ve never met, go eat a food you&rsquo;ve never tried, watch a movie you normally wouldn&rsquo;t, just try something new. When was the last time you called that one friend you haven&rsquo;t talked to in a while? Meet up with them and catch up on life or go read a book. Look at old pictures go on Facebook and reminisce about what you did in college. Are you the same person? Have you really grown? These are things that life can surprise us with. Give people chances, they might just surprise you as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;re only confined by the walls that you build yourself. How many walls are you building? How thick are you making them? If you had to take your walls down right now, could you? Man, these walls can be rough, they don&rsquo;t let anyone in and they sure don&rsquo;t let us out! Walls are dangerous because they keep you separated from things that can help you. If you have a wall up, how can you go out and get the stuff that you&#39;re going to need in order to grow? How are you going to go out there and meet new people and have new experiences? Walls, while they&#39;re great for protection, they&#39;re horrible for growth. They confine you and limit your possibilities. So yes, even as the author of this book on diversity, I have walls too. When I was writing this book, I was confined by walls of doubt. Will my book be good? Will people read it? Am I going to be criticized? Are people going to just look at this book and say, &ldquo;Man, he just went off...none of these things are even related. It was all over the place. I can&rsquo;t follow what he&rsquo;s saying.&rdquo; But for me, I can&rsquo;t be confined by those walls of skepticism or by the walls of fear. So, I decided to put a door on this wall. That way, the wall is still up, but I had the ability to go in and out. I can take constructive criticism. I can take that not everybody is going to like the text. But I will not allow myself to be confined by these walls. This means that there are times when I&rsquo;m going to need to come out and sometimes I&#39;m going to be a little vulnerable, and that&rsquo;s okay. Being vulnerable, means you&rsquo;re human. Being vulnerable, means your imperfect. Not all walls are immune to penetration, sometimes people get in and that&rsquo;s okay too. Maybe they are there for reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you haven&#39;t failed at anything, you haven&#39;t tried hard enough. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help. If you need counseling, take it. It&rsquo;s okay to say you&#39;re not okay! People want to be strong and not show signs of weakness. But, you can&rsquo;t be strong everyday of your life. There&rsquo;s going to come a time when you will need help and support. No one is a one person show. Sometimes you have to take the plunge and start caring about something with all your heart and energy. You have know that you can&rsquo;t fully and truly care about it if you are holding yourself back. This fear will prevent you from succeeding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#39;t think you always make the right choice. I think you make a choice and then you make it right. A lot of times we choose things, thinking they&rsquo;re the best for us, only to find out that they&#39;re not. When that happens to most people, they kind of just pout and say, &ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t want that to happen and now that it happened, I guess I just have to deal with it.&rdquo; No! Make the best out of your situation. You need to align yourself with people who fit your destiny not your history. If you go on vacation and it&rsquo;s raining, who cares?! Some people don&rsquo;t get to go on vacation! Make the best out of that situation; go dance in the rain, go to a movie, or just take a nap. When life gives you lemons, don&rsquo;t just make the lemonade, make a lemon pie too! Do you know how many situations didn&#39;t work out for me? What did I do? I made the best out of it and it ended up being better than planned. Why?&nbsp; Because I took the initiative. Where&rsquo;s the initiative people? Where&rsquo;s the drive? Where&rsquo;s the pizzazz? Where&rsquo;s the creativity? We have to get back to those things. Those are the things that make life fun for us &ndash; the things that make life enjoyable and even sometimes, those are the things that make life worth living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normal is a fantasy. What is normal to a wolf is chaos to a sheep. We have to break these self-prescribed norms. We need to be able to do things that are different. I can&#39;t live in normal. I need to do something new. I have to go out. I have to challenge my own thinking. I&#39;ve got to go against what I originally thought I would do. I have to keep my mind open knowing that there are other possibilities out there. And that is hard for me, because as Justin, I like things my way. I know some of you who know me personally are probably thinking, &ldquo;Yup, he sure does!&rdquo; I like things my way and I can be impatient, both of those are very true. They don&#39;t make me a bad person, they just make me a human. Who wants to be normal anyway? Who wants to live a normal life? Who wants to live a boring, careful life? Sometimes you&#39;ve got to be carefree. Sometimes you&#39;ve got to break down the existence of your old thinking. Just get out there!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to make a legacy, and you can only make a legacy once there&rsquo;s revolution. Revolution can only be created once people are inspired. Are you inspired?&nbsp; Did the book inspire you? Were there things in it that you could take and learn from? I truly hope so. I spent a lot of time making this book &ndash; it is probably about 10 years in the making. In my Diversity Awareness Programs, no one learns more than I do. That happens because I&rsquo;m more than a participant. I&rsquo;m more than a presenter. I&rsquo;m more than a facilitator. I&#39;m someone who&#39;s conducting a focus group. So, the almost 400 schools I visited were a giant focus group; giant surveys or assessment tools that helped me figure out what is going on in people&rsquo;s lives. How can I get a grasp of it? What do I need to do as a professional to help meet people&#39;s needs where they are at. Not just one person, but everybody. It&#39;s always a beautiful day to change lives and I always want to do that. Do you want to change lives? Are you making an impact? I hope so. My goal with this book was to be able to change your life. Have I been able to do that? I just know that there are a lot of great people out there. More importantly, there are a lot of great people out there who don&#39;t know that they&#39;re great...yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be the person who can be great for somebody else. Continue to strive, kick down doors, and be awesome. I always tell my students, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be dope, live dopely.&rdquo; This means be best version of yourself. In life, you should only be competing with yourself. Make yourself a better version of you. Take time to get to know you. Take time to work on yourself. Take time to be the best person you can be. As Justin LaKyle Brown, I&rsquo;m signing off. I&#39;ll be here whenever you need me; all you have to do is read the last chapter of this book. I&rsquo;m here &ndash; these are my words. This is what my heart is and like I said, when you&rsquo;re looking for me, you&rsquo;ll find me in the crowd of life changers. You&rsquo;ll find me in the crowd of those who are servant leaders. You&#39;ll find me in the place that&#39;s trying to make a difference in people&#39;s lives. If this book was helpful to you, I hope that you&rsquo;ll pass it on to someone else that needs it too. Someone else who may need some words of encouragement. Someone else who is trying to learn, because that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about. When you know better you do better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2020-05-29 13:34:05', '2020-05-29 13:34:05', NULL);

(1, 1, 'en', '\"It\'s your world, change it or someone else will.\" ~Gary Lew', 'The purpose of D.A.P. is to promote diversity and cultural awareness in all aspects of life to the students, faculty, and staff on the University campus through active engagements of active discussions on social issues and ideas. D.A.P. will serve as a resourceful bound in encouraging students and members to seek opportunities to become more culturally aware and conscious. \r\n\r\nThe organization has educated students by inviting a diverse group of people together and participating in activities that not only help them to know each other in small groups but also having discussion topics as a large group.\r\n\r\nOverall the groups hope to help the campuses and workplaces realize just because you have this judgment about a particular group of people does not mean it applies to the whole group, hence stereotypes. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, this organization has grown and progressed into a known and well-loved organization. As an organization with 1200 participants\r\nand over 650 members., they have promoted diversity and created friendships amongst each other that go beyond the timed training and meetings. \r\n\r\nThe organization is led by Justin Brown, creator. This organization is one where you can come for support, and come to be better educated and aware of diversity throughout your university campus, workplace and your future.\r\n\r\nIn only its third year of existence, the energy and commitment of the collective whole of its membership is amazingly strong.  It has approximately 650 members meeting voluntarily coming together to discuss, play, and challenge each other on social issues, ideas, personal relationships, stereotypes, cultural identities, and so much more.\r\n\r\nThe workshop presentation will showcase the driving force of D.A.P.  –and will highlight activities, ideas, and personal reflection of how and why D.A.P. became so hugely popular and so important on so many levels on our campus community.\r\n\r\nFurther discussion and handouts will reveal demonstrated successes and intentionally, planned strategies of developing student and cultural identity competencies. D.A.P’. members are trained as trainers to provide diversity and prejudice-reduction workshops. The integration of the D.A.P. Educator Outreach members with the first-year seminar program (reaching over 93% of first-year student population) and can be integrated into other student life/campus programs and by-faculty invitation into other academic discipline classrooms.\r\n\r\nAssessment\r\n\r\nThe following statistics are results from D.A.P. surveys administered to over 500 students, staff, student\r\naffairs professionals and participants. Each completed the survey after participating in the program.\r\n\r\n• 87.6% of participants’ survey said I feel more equipped to talk about diversity in regards to gender,\r\nrace, ethnicity, religion, physical ability, sexual orientation, language, age, and social class towards\r\nan analysis of equity.\r\n\r\n• 91.2% of participants’ survey said the session improved my understanding to develop a basic\r\nfoundation of ethics, respect for diversity, and more thorough awareness of topics related to diversity.\r\n\r\n• 95% of participants’ survey said the session improved my understanding to develop a basic\r\nfoundation of ethics, respect for diversity, and more thorough awareness of topics related to diversity.\r\n\r\n• 98% of participants’ survey said I was challenged by this program to explore challenges that surface\r\namidst interactions between people of different backgrounds, world views, environmental\r\nopportunities, and how social contexts exacerbate or reduce those challenges.\r\n\r\n• 97.5.2% of participants’ survey said I felt like I was in a safe place.\r\n\r\n• 91% of participants’ survey said I feel that this program should be repeated on my campus.\r\n\r\n• 97.5% of participants’ survey said they thoroughly enjoyed the program.\r\n\r\nStyle and Type of Presentation\r\n\r\nThis 2-hour high energy presentation incorporates very strong fundamental ideas and concepts on topics\r\nrelating to diversity. Topics are presented in a new and exciting way, which allows students to actively\r\nengage in discussions on social issues and ideas. Justin’s presentation style is high energy, while\r\ndemonstrating his approach in interaction amongst the participating individuals. Justin’s approach to\r\nengage students is unique: his sessions are dynamic and organized, and his enthusiasm for crowd\r\nparticipation motivates and encourages students to actively participate. Justin uses various sources of\r\nmedia in his workshops such as PowerPoint, video clips, cell phones, role playing and games to create a\r\nconstructive learning environment. Students will feel comfortable, eager to participate and ready to learn\r\nmore about each other and themselves. One of Justin’s most useful techniques is the “turn and talk”\r\nmethod. This is where he says, “Turn to your partner, friend, teammate, etc.” and students engage in the\r\nactivity. He also likes to use the “call and answer” method, where he asks the audience a series of\r\nquestions and they respond. The program is fun from beginning to end, and participants walk away\r\nlearning useful tips, techniques and strategies to help them in their daily lives.\r\n\r\nLearning Outcomes\r\n\r\n1.1- Students will engage in experiential learning in the domains of gender, race, ethnicity, religion,\r\nphysical ability, sexual orientation, language, age, and social class towards an analysis of equity.\r\n\r\n1.2- Students will explore challenges that surface amidst interactions between people of different\r\nbackgrounds, world views, environmental opportunities, and how social contexts exacerbate or reduce\r\nthose challenges.\r\n\r\n1.3- Students will participate in thought-provoking, fun activities in large and small groups that will\r\nchallenge thinking, understanding, society views and personal experiences.\r\n\r\n1.4- Students will be able to demonstrate an understanding of relationships in diversity, inequality, and\r\nsocial, economic, and political power both in the United States and globally.\r\n\r\n1.5- Students will be able to demonstrate an understanding of relationships in diversity, inequality, and\r\nsocial, economic, and political power both in the United States and globally.', 1, '2020-05-15 19:14:02', '2020-09-24 00:54:18', NULL),
